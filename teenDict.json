In high school, you're up at 6am and if you play a sport or other school related activity, you're probably not home until 6pm.  Dinner and then studying/hw?  Probably close to 8 or 9 now.

It  has made life so much better. Nobody expects more of me than what they did when I lived at home, I just have more freedom.\n\nThe huge impact of having responsibilites but no freedom didn't hit me until I didn't have it anymore, it's so liberating. I've seen other people mentioning the school system, and I absolutely agree. Luckily tho, in Norway, upper secondary school (11th - 13th grade) isn't mandatory, so they expect us to manage the classes by ourselves, and don't give us homework. \n\nBut yeah, I'm expected to act like an adult, but I actually have the freedom of an adult, and that has taken such a huge weight off my shoulders", "agreed.\n\nalways found it funny how we're expected to keep up with the massive amounts of homework and whatnot, but we don't even have the pleasure of going to the bathroom without asking.\n\nit's the worst of both worlds lmao", "My grandpa doesn\u2019t let me have an opinion because I\u2019m \u201cnot grown\u201d yet tells me to do certain things because \u201cI\u2019m grown\u201d and I genuinely don\u2019t know how to process what he says.", "Not a teen, but this is definitely a problem I see with parents.\n\nWhen the kid is a kid everything they do is \"cute\". Hell, parents even go out of their way to pay for say, their daughter to take a dance class that does sexy hip shaking at the recital. Nd it's all cute because it's a 6 year old. BUT, the second the parent notices that their kid is too old it's immediately \"You can't do that it's inappropriate! Act like a lady!\" There's mens versions too. \n\nGenerally I think parents view pre-puberty as a sacred innocent child time, and they don't want to face the fact it's temporary and actually teach their kids anything about adult life. But then when their kids get too old for that, they instantly demand that their kids be completely responsible and handle the new feelings they were never even warned of, let alone educated about.\n\nSimilarly post puberty, there's all these things parents don't think their kid should be responsible for at their current age. But again, like a switch, the second the parent feels their kid is old enough they hold them to that standard with 0 warm up time.\n\nAnd of course, there's the flawed human selfish aspect of it too: Parent in the wrong? \"You're a kid, you know nothing and should do what I say\".

I don\u2019t think something that I will never use decides how far I can go in life it\u2019s bs.\n\nOne more topic is that (as I mentioned earlier I\u2019m saving for a pc) my dad was willing to go halves with me to buy a new MacBook for school (he said he was going to but me one for grade 7 and when the time came he said he would buy me one before grade 8 and then when that came he said he will pay for half) and he would go halves with me to buy and iMac because he bought himself one but if I build one that\u2019s the EXACT SAME PRICE but I get to learn how to do it, learn about the parts and things and get a better computer he won\u2019t go halves with me like wtf and his only reason is because I\u2019ll use it to play games but I would do that on an iMac if I got one. Also my mum wouldn\u2019t go halves with me on a pc because I don\u2019t need more video games and shouldn\u2019t spend that money on videogames but I\u2019ll use it for school as well for years and it gives me a responsibility to save for it and to manage my money while saving.\n\nOverall being 14 is so good but so bad, I don\u2019t have much homework yet and have slight freedom but I\u2019m treated like a child and told to act like I\u2019m 18 and living by myself.

You could argue that, sure, Jack Napier in Tim Burton\u2019s Batman did create Batman by murdering thinks and Martha Wayne, but Jack continued his crime working for the mob, and took even more lives when he became the Joker.\n\nSpoilers for Joker\n\n>!While Joker didn\u2019t directly murder Thomas and Martha Wayne, it is clearly because of what he did, so it counts. In the movie, we see joker directly kill 6 people, this being the three Wall Street guys, Penny Fleck, Randall, and Murray. It is implied that he killed the social worker at the end scene due to his bloody footsteps, bringing the total count to 7. It is also unknown what he could have done to Sophie and her daughter in her apartment, but I personally believe that he didn\u2019t harm either of them. Already, Joker has quite the kill count. But the chaos he starts in Gotham city most likely took many more lives, One of the detectives shot a protester on the train, causing the mob to beat both detectives nearly to death. Then, the ambulance that crashed into the squad car to free Joker killed the two officers in the front seats of the car. Lastly, Thomas and Martha Wayne are short and hilled by one of the protesters, bringing a complete total of onscreen deaths to 12, 15 if we count the detectives (who probably will be paralyzed for the rest of their lives) and Sophie if we assume Arthur killed her. But we haven\u2019t even touched how many lives could have been lost in the riots that put Gotham in flames at the end of the movie. The riot in Gotham involved violence, flames, and looting, (rioters can be seen outside the movie theater with some boxes that look like they were in a store) making it similar to 1967 Detroit riots, which lasted five days. 43 people died in those riots, and 342 injured. If we assume that Joker directly killed 15 people himself, than it\u2019s safe to assume that Joker caused the deaths of 58 people, potentially a lot more due to the intensity of Gotham\u2019s riots. Batman would have to save 58 people\u2013but more likely lots more\u2013for Joker to have \u201csaved lives\u201d. But I would argue that without Joker, there would be no need for Batman, and as pointed out by Commissioner Gordon in Batman Begins, Batman\u2019s presence in Gotham would make the criminals more violent.!<", "/snort /pushes up glasses, not really since thomas and martha wayne were lifting up the cities poor and downtrodden while pushing for legislation to fight for economic equality.

Very badly.\n\n\u200b\n\nTLDR at bottom.\n\n\u200b\n\nTo preface, I used to masturbate a lot, and still sometimes do. Usually, I do it in the shower. For around an hour (whenever I get the chance).\n\n\u200b\n\nSo today I had the great idea based on the notion of \"since shampoo feels soft in my hands/hair, maybe it would feel good on my dick?\" So I took a whole bunch in my hand, and rubbed it all over. It felt good at first too, basically what you would imagine it to feel like.\n\n\u200b\n\nThen I got the great idea of sticking it in the shampoo bottle.\n\n\u200b\n\nWith some effort (not to flex but my dick is pretty wide) I managed to get it in there completely. This was not a good idea. First of all, I couldn't even move it around cuz it was super tight. Like there was so much friction, it was stuck. And I couldn't move it out either. I started to panic. I looked like a complete idiot, my entire penis encased by this huge bottle. I tried jumping up and down, pulling it off with my hands, then my feet, it was such an ordeal.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe entire time, my dick was floating around in shampoo-y substances, which wasn't a problem at first. Until it started FUCKING BURNING.\n\n\u200b\n\nHOLY HELL I cannot accurately describe the pain of having a burning schlong. It was this icy-fire feeling, that kept throbbing continuously. I could barely stop myself from screaming. Tears and all, I was a mess.\n\n\u200b\n\nAt this point I would do anything to get it off. So I figured out a plan, dried myself, put on my biggest pair of pants (some flannel) to hide the giant-ass shampoo bottle and a t-shirt so I could get some butter from the fridge. So as I'm making my way to the fridge, MY MOM tells me to come up to her room to \"talk about my academic failure,\"\n\n\u200b\n\nI sat through 20 minutes of her talking shit about me with a freezing-burning penis. After that shit-show, I tried running back to my room. I was sweating, crying, and couldn't hold my own weight. I fell down on my knees and crawled the rest of the way to my room with my melted butter stick.\n\n\u200b\n\nTo shorten a long process, I rubbed some butter over the lid, and after a while, the bottle popped off to reveal my burning-red manhood.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs i'm writing this, my dick still hasn't fully healed, and I think I ripped the skin, which means no more masturbating for a while\n\n\u200b\n\nLesson: Never, EVER, stick your dick in a shampoo bottle.\n\n\u200b\n\nTLDR: Got horny, thought it would be a good idea to put my dick into a shampoo bottle. Turned out not to be a good idea. Got stuck for 40 minutes. burning. ow. butter stick came off. shriveled, reddened cock.\n\n\u200b\n\nUpdate: Upon further examination, the skin is a couple shades redder than it usually is, I can see red enflamed muscle-y things where the skin peeled off, and the entire thing looks like armadillo skin.

I know many of you find it boring, and a waste of time, and think both sides are exactly the same, etc. But really, they\u2019re not, especially when it comes down to the original (except the Republicans, they have been thoroughly corrupt for many decades now and are solely responsible for most of the laws that keep the poor and exploited forever in those positions, and the rich richer and more powerful, and new energy and medical technologies suppressed, and keep universal healthcare bills suppressed, and medical costs high, and wages low). I really wish more of you would get involved, and discuss it with each other.\n\nMany of you here are at or going to be at the voting age. Take it with a grain of salt, but I used to be totally against both parties, and even didn\u2019t believe in Obama (in reality the presidents don\u2019t have much say in war operations, commander in chief is mostly a title, not a frequently used job duty, otherwise Trump would have completely fucked us and the entire world by now), and after all the years I have been following what\u2019s been going on in the world, just ONE person really stuck out in all of this bullshit. Bernie Sanders. If you google his accomplishments, and what he\u2019s been fighting for, you\u2019ll see all the amendments he has passed, the movements he has participated in, his arrests for supporting brown and LGBTQ people, and his never ending fight against corrupt corporations and lawmakers who keep the rich rich and powerful and the weak poor and exploited. If you have the ability to vote in this election, please read and talk about Bernie.\n\nThink of this as a message from the future you. I wish I had participated more, especially in the 2016 elections. Just like we have seen in all the time traveling movies, one person doing small things can change the world. I think I myself could have done so much better to promote Bernie that I honestly think he could have won if I myself tried a little harder, and by now all of us would have had \u201cfree\u201d college and healthcare, paid for by exactly the same way that your public school education and other community/government services are paid for, by a little bit from everyone, way cheaper than what we pay to corporations by several orders of magnitude. \n\nAny single one of you could make that decision today, to pay a little more attention to politics, and discuss it with your peers in person and on social media, and change the future of this country for the better.", "This is actually kind of realistic taking into consideration the advances of technology.", "I'm 114, and it's dope (is that what the kids say these days?) to be mentioned every once in awhile.", "I have a chance to prove myself worthy!", "4206913", "Imagine you turning 113 and you come back and everyone is calling you a boomer", "\"I have the same amount of existential dread as I had when I was a young'n\" -said some 115 yr old", "If somebody reaches 13000 years old, are they a teenager for the next 6999 years?", "He's too dangerous to be kept alive!", "See ya guys and gals in 100 years", "Yes they would I asked the same thing a couple of months ago", "[removed]", "r/techniclythetruth", "So us 215 year olds aren\u2019t allowed smh", "Why the fuck did this get 10k upvotes, this is the longest running fuckin joke on this sub.

So the so called standard shouldn't really exist.\n\nMen are also expected to be the stronger counterpart, normally both physically and mentally. Let's focus on the mental part of that. Just because men are men, does not mean they must hide their emotions. It's ok to show it sometimes, it's alright to cry, it's alright to let it out and talk about what's dragging you down.

It sounds like you are at least up stairs.\nCheck for small red spots.  They may almost be indistinguishable from acne (I went thru that too)  so, also check bedding, dresser and clothes for anything that looks like chocolate, wood chips or straw - this is their nests, shedding and poop - you may have seen it and thought that it was part of the wall, or lint, etc.\n\nThey are really a problem and if you can take a moment and consider that a possibility, what I want you to do is clean-up everything.  Wash everything and dust out drawers with spray (windex is fine) and immediately make an effort to keep things clean and orderly.  Open a window at times when it is below freezing to slow down possible spread.  A small infestation may stay small forever, but a few bites every night can elevate all your fight or flight mechanisms.\n\nYou will not be able to see them.  There are pictures, but they are rare and usually of highly invasive dynamic varieties (like army ants to dust ants) which are unusual.  Majority of bed bugs are microscopic, but the reddish-brown residue (should it exist) would be a dead give away of a moderate infestation.\n\nOf course there are also spiders which live in your eyebrows #AdultSwim among others but most eat things like dust mites - these too can cause paranoia.\n\nAlso, it isn\u2019t that there isn\u2019t a sound you are hearing, but perhaps you would have ignored it in other circumstances.

I have known people ending up in the psych ward for months and after helping their families get them out discovered the brown remains of bed bug nests.  However, their parents would always say they were so dirty/messy.  No one brings dirt like that into the bed.\n\nThen again, could be an intruder.

One day, he sets up a livestream, and records him stabbing himself and falling into a river that led to the ocean. Police reports say he committed suicide, and that his body washed out to sea. 15 years later, one of the girls is found dead along with her husband and children all with large stab wounds. Police found a bottle of sleeping pills on the dining room table, and theorize that the killer slipped the sleeping pills into the family\u2019s drinks, and struck after the fell asleep. One officer went into one of the bedrooms, and found on a wall, written in blood,\u201d I\u2019m baaaaaaack! And you can\u2019t accuse me of anything now!\u201d. The police were baffled.The next week goes on as normal, but no signs of the killer anywhere. Then Saturday comes, and another call of a murder going on across the street, and then screaming, then glass shatters, then: a new voice, one dark and raspy, as if It hadn\u2019t been used in ages, and the it had been screamed at the top of his lungs for three years. The voice said,\u201d you didn\u2019t help me, while you knew I was innocent. I know who those of you are, and I\u2019m just starting with.......some of the people that ruined my life\u201d, then whoever the voice belonged to put down the phone. Everyone immediately tracked the signal, and found it at one of the other girls houses, and with her entire family dead on the floor, without sleeping pills to be seen and missing their heads. The lady who was across the street however, was not dead upon closer inspection, and was merely paralyzed, from fear. She might as well had been dead however, as she couldn\u2019t talk. All her words were slurred and stuttered, and the only thing the police could make out was,\u201dd-d-d-dead\u201d. The police realized the pattern, the girls that accused a boy of sexual assault, causing him to kill himself. They sent an officer after a week to the last girls house, which she was fine with. That night, there was a knock on the door, the officer was terrified by what he saw: a long, slender, rotting body. He had glowing red eyes and molded teeth, his entire nose was missing and his bone was showing in parts. He had on teared, tattered clothes covered in barnacles and   You could see where his lungs used to be. The officer was in shock, he thought this shit only happened in movies! But before he could pull out his gun, the dead man pulled a knife out of his chest and stabbed the officer in the crotch. The officer yowled with pain as the dead man slowly moved the knife upwards, slicing him open. The officer fell back, organs and guts spilling out. The girl screamed as the dead man walked closer and whispered in her ear,\u201d you ruined my life till I ended it, now, I have killed your friends, your, family, boyfriend, and the officer protecting you, you are the last one on my list\u201d, and with that, he stabbed her in the eye.

I took it from her before my wasted children could fall out and told her it was a knife cleaner. \n   She becomes so proud of me and acts like I\u2019m Albert Einstein if he took steroids instead of aderall. I disposed of the glove (easy cleaning. Like I said, fucking engineer.) and went on with my day like nothing happened.

I pretend that I have no idea what he\u2019s freaking out about. I lubed that thing up with dish soap, stuck a knife in that thing, and started to jack it slowly to not cut myself and scrub the curry off of it. \n   She looks in awe and asks me to make her one to keep inside the cabinet and to buy more gloves when I\u2019m coming home from the gym.

This shouldn't even be an unpopular opinion, people just don't think about what the word \"difficult\" actually means.\n\nPeeing with a boner is more difficult than giving birth. Giving birth is definitely more painful, but pain by itself does not make something difficult. For example, putting my hand in a fire is not difficult, but it would hurt a lot. In order for something to be difficult, there has to be some chance of failure due to lack of skill, practice, or technique. Peeing with a boner often requires creative problem solving skills, especially in small spaces. There is no creative problem solving aspect of giving birth. Additionally, the way humans have evolved for these two actions supports my point. Giving birth is a natural process, which humans have evolved to be able to do. The female body is literally designed so that it can give birth with the lowest possible chance of error. The only real error that can happen is a miscarriage, which is also a natural occurrence, not a failure that occurs due to a lack of skill in giving birth. The male body, on the other hand, has evolved specifically so that peeing with a boner is very difficult. The only purpose for having a boner is to impregnate a woman, so the male body evolved to prevent urination during sex. On top of the difficulty in simply getting the pee to flow, there's the issue of actually positioning yourself so that the boner is pointing into the toilet bowl (urinals are much easier, but not always an option). In the past, I have had to give up and wait until my boner goes away because it was simply too difficult to actually pee in the toilet. There has never been a case where a woman has tried to give birth after being pregnant for nine months, not been able to do it, and said \"fuck it\" and waited 3 more months to try again because it would be easier the second try. Giving birth happens, every single time, because it's a natural process - peeing with a boner is the opposite. \n\nIn conclusion, peeing with a boner is hard.\n\nPutting a few counter arguments in here:\n\n1. Peeing with a boner doesn't kill babies, so of course we put more medical effort into giving birth. Also, I'm talking about the actual act of pushing the baby out, not doctors trying to save someone else's baby from dying due to a NATURALLY OCCURRING error, not a woman not having enough skill to successfully deliver the baby. Oh, and don't forget that giving birth has been around way longer than doctors. We don't need them, they just decrease the natural rate of failure that comes with creating an entire new human. As another user said in this comment section, we used to give birth in caves wearing loincloths.  \n\n  \n\n2. You obviously have very little understanding of how evolution works. Humans have not reached some perfect form where all of our bodily functions are flawless. And yes, it is 100 percent true that we have evolved to be able to give birth. If you don't think that's true, you know nothing about evolution and should probably just stop using it as an argument. Evolution makes us more likely to pass on our DNA, and giving birth is literally a process in which we pass on our DNA to a new human. Small random changes over time, as well as natural selection through probability have both made it more and more likely for babies to survive childbirth. But since the human body has many purposes besides giving birth, it cannot possibly be a perfect birth-giving machine. There at inevitable natural errors that happen, and that's just the way it is. Again, I'm also only talking about the act of actually pushing the baby out, not the doctors who help out. Standing in the shower to pee? Since when were there showers in gas station bathrooms?  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n3. When I wait for the boner to go away, I'm avoiding peeing with a boner. Read that sentence again. **IT MEANS I'M NOT FUCKING PEEING WITH A BONER.** Peeing *with a boner* is the hard part, not just peeing. And just because giving birth requires effort does not mean it is difficult. It happens every time. I think you're ignoring the ways we've evolved mentally to be able to give birth. Yet another way in which you misunderstand what evolution is. It is natural instinct for a woman to do what is required to give birth. Everything she *needs* is there from the moment she hits puberty, in both the physical and mental categories, as well as the chemicals that are produced in the brain. As for the pain? Evolution isn't meant to make you happy, it's meant to make you survive. The point of pain is to make people safer. It's meant to make you think twice about doing something that might cause you to feel pain. Maybe if there was no pain I giving birth, humans in the past would've had way too many kids and would've been worse off because their instincts would be to protect all of them, which would be a burden.  \n\n   \n\n\n4. As I said above, the purpose of waiting until the boner goes away is so that you don't have to pee with a boner, because it's difficult. I guess I shouldn't have assumed that the people reading this post would be smart enough to figure that out.  \n\n\nFinally, giving birth is...  \n\n\n#INEVITABLE.  \n\n\nTherefore it never doesn't happen due to a lack of skill from the birth-giver. Peeing with a boner does. The point I'm trying to make with this post is that peeing with a boner is like a 3 on the difficulty scale (varies based on dick size and bathroom size) and giving birth is inapplicable to the definition of \"difficult.\"", ["I read this as giving birth with a boner by accident.", "Peeing with a boner also increases the effective range and pressure, good for tactical pissing", "[removed]", "Bro just plank on the toilet", "Did you just write a whole essay on peeing with a boner.

There are a lot of factors that can make a birth difficult, and I would say more difficult than peeing with a boner. Though I have not given birth at this point in my life, here a few facts for you to consider. \n\n1. Time limit. The longer a birth takes the more dangerous it becomes for mother and her child. \n\n2. Umbilical cord. It occasionally gets wrapped around the baby in dangerous ways that can lead to the baby braking a limb or even getting strangled.\n\n3. You said that women are designed to have children with the least complications possible, and in principal we are but it\u2019s more complicated than that. When humans became bipedal our hips became narrower. This caused birth to come much sooner during pregnancy because the baby would become too big to exit the birth canal at any later point. Because the baby is so young it is much more delicate which means the smallest of complications can threaten its life.\n\n4. For the majority of human history it was commonplace for a woman and/or her baby to die during child birth. I doubt that has ever been the case for peeing with a boner.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean to write an essay but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to compare the two, let alone say that peeing with a boner is harder.

However, why do human women have such narrow hips then?

You wait 5 minutes in giving birth? A lot of complications for the mother and the baby.  Also for women who have given birth before, it is MUCH easier to keep giving birth than a first time mother. \n\nAnd your talk about pain is hilarious because birth has always been painful yet people kept reproducing and having babies.

Using this definition, your argument would be valid. \n\nBut here is the Google definition of difficult:\n\nneeding much *effort* or skill to accomplish, deal with, or understand. Synonyms: strenuous, *laborious*, arduous\n\nFrom my own Merriam-Webster:\n\nhard to do or make; And then some definitions of hard: difficult to bear, harsh, severe, intense in force or manner\n\nNowhere does it *single out* the need of skill as the sole measure of difficulty, if you have alternate credible definitions, please let me know. \n\nIn the end, they are just such weird things to compare.

Men have an increased risk of depression and suicide?? Try giving birth!!!\" Yea, it's very stupid, and I admit that this is shitty. But making that argument that men don't suffer because they don't give birth is, in my opinion, just as silly as trying to make the argument that giving birth is more \\*difficult\\* than peeing with a boner, because again, they are such vastly different and thus weird and unfair things to compare.", "i think about this copypasta a lot", "um", "Even if this is a copypasta take\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28e0\u28c4\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28e0\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28c4\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28e0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c4\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28e0\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28c4\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2880\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2840\u2800\n\u2800\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2819\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u280b\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800", "[deleted]", "More difficult, but way less painful", "link to the original copypasta?", "My strat at home is to stand back a few feet then angle the piss stream to go into the toilet because for me it is harder to point down", "Boner control will come with time.

It only tried to deal with eliminating racism while ignoring the issues found in the african American community that leads to so many social problems.

The problem I think is that, nothing is being done to fix some of the issues I mentioned above because a lot of American society thinks that trying to fix them is racist and would rather fund BLM for anti-racism rather than fund organisations trying to deal with some of the issues that lead to heated social climates.\n\n\nBLM has done a lot of shady things in the past and the more you ask about African Americans's opinions, especially the older people, BLM support starts to fall drastically.\n\n\nIn Romania, a large chunk of the population are Romani, also known as gypsies. Europe has always had a big racism problem out Romani and they are usually mistreated and in poor conditions in most European countries. But Romania is the difference where Romani are not a different social class, but just another ethnicity. Romania has taken for a long while measures to improve life of romani people as many start out in poor families or unfit homes. The system takes special attention to make sure kids from Romani families have all the means to full education and watches out for issues in neighboorhoods and tries to make sure young people dont go doing dumb stuff because of their impoverished situation, and today because of that in Romania racism against Romani people is pretty low. There are still stigmas and jokes thrown around but actual harassment is rare to come by and everyone accepts them as just ordinary citizens and have been accepting them for a while.\n\n\nAmerica has not done this and I think it's the reason why things always get so heated over there.

For the past ~3yrs you\u2019ve provided me with encouragement when I needed it, support during my shittiest of days,and waaaay too many memories to name. This subreddit has always been my favorite community, my favorite to browse, my favorite to participate in, and my favorite to moderate. \n\nIn fact the only reason I ever wanted to mod this place was because of how much I absolutely love it here. I wanted to help this place keep whatever stupid magic it has that enables it to consistently have such a kickass group of /new/ users. Even when one group of users find that the sub no longer appeals to them, another group of lovely people come to take their place. You\u2019d think a sub full of teens would be a mess and well...it is, ngl. But it\u2019s the good kind of mess that always works out in the end. Never have a seen a sub back each other up so much, seen people stand up for each other, look out for each other, and all around be great human beings to one another. You\u2019d hope to see those things all over reddit, but it just isn\u2019t like that.\n\nThe sub has changed A LOT over the time I\u2019ve been an active user here. I think when I started coming here we were at 100k subscribers and now we\u2019re over a million. I rebelled during the zero content policy back in 2016, I posted (way too many) selfies in selfie threads, posted my kik in dozens of kik threads (tbt awildjoeyappeared), and made friends who are complete idiots (/u/dullember is forever blacklisted for liking palkia more than dialga). But the core values of this ~~hellhole~~ great place have stayed the same. \n\nSo I leave you with this - Stop posting ama number threads for fucks sake. Or at least if you do, copy and paste the number threads into the body of a post and let *everyone* participate you selfish fucks. Stop posting \u201cscreenshot and repost\u201d memes, y\u2019all ain't funny. And when the next big movie comes out, *don\u2019t spoil it* for those who are excited to see it. \n\nBe nice to the ~~nazis~~ mods. They\u2019re all genuinely great people who I\u2019m so happy I\u2019ve been able to get to know. S/o to /u/Elite_Jackelope, best /r/teenagers mod **EVER**. *ily.* /u/satanslimpdick pls remember to subscribe to pewdiepie.

All you other slaves, get back to work. <3\n\nI could leave y\u2019all with some cheesy advice rn but this is already long af.

Here.  Read this, it'll help.  Her spirit will be with you always.\n\n     OLD DOGS DON'T DIE:\n\nOld dogs don't die; they can't. They've merely run up ahead; they're waiting for us just out of sight. Close your eyes late at night and you may smell his musky odor, or perhaps hear his snuffle from the next room. Pay attention and you may feel his nose on your hand or the back of your calf. When your final day comes, you can go on to meet him; he's never left you and never will, and when you close your eyes for the last time, you'll open them again to be met with his Bright eyes and wagging tail.\n\nOld dogs don't die, at least, not those dogs who take the biggest chunks of our hearts with them when they leave us. Those dogs are inextricably part of our souls, and they go with us wherever we are. Though we may not see them, we know they're there because our heart is still beating; we still breathe, and those of us who have been truly touched by a good dog know our lives really started the day we met them.\n\nMagnificent dogs don't die. They shepherd our dreams and only allow the good ones through the gates of our consciousness. They watch over us much as they did in life, and that moment when we step just barely outside of death or disaster, it's because they moved our feet or they stopped short in front of us as they did in life. \n\nYou see, a good dog is something only given to a few people. They are a gift from the universe and, though they're with us only a short time, they never really leave us. They are loyalty and love perfected, and once we are graced with that sort of love we can never lose it. We merely lose sight of it for a time, and that is our fault; for how can love like that ever go away?\n\nIt can't. It can't, and it never will. For these brave souls trade their hearts for ours, and they beat together beyond sickness, beyond death. They are ours, and we are theirs, for every sunrise and every sunset, until the sun blazes its last and we once again join the stars.\n\nAuthor Unknown.", "I got this little teacup Pomeranian.

Alright, end of PSA.\n\nA study conducted on some young men found that men who realized they had raped someone, adjusted their definition of rape so they wouldn't fall under it. Let me explain.\n\nThe study gathered a bunch of college age men, and interviewed them individually. They asked for their definition of rape, and then recorded it down. They also asked more about whether they thought they had raped someone, and some other questions. Then they proceeded to ask the young men about their experiences, what they had done, whether they had an experience of something specific. Then they repeated the definition, explaining that under their definition, they had raped someone. A lot of these instances were cases where their partner had been iffy about it and coerced into doing it. The men doubled back, changing the definition.         \nThey didn't \\*want\\* to be rapists. They knew raping someone was wrong. But its obviously not that simple. Clearly they still did it. They're still rapists.\n\nWhat does this teach us:  \n1. Teaching about consent PROPERLY is extremely important. That way it is at least ingrained it people's minds that they are coercing someone, which is rape.\n\n2. People can be raped in relationships. Like a lot of issues, such as kidnapping and sexual assault, it can come from those close to you. That's really scary, but it's important people know, because as much as I wish this wasn't the case, there are people out there who will try to hammer through boundaries and people's wishes, and people need to keep themselves safe.\n\n3. Off of number 2, rape isn't just some scary man chasing a woman down an alley. It can be from a lot of different places.\n\n4. Keep people accountable. If it happens, DONT let it happen again. You learn your friend is coercing people into sex? Get them in trouble, and keep them away from those they are hurting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally found this study really interesting. It gives us a broader look on what this issue is .", "Let\u2019s say there are two people. A rapist and a soon to be victim of rape from that rapist. They are at a party, and the only one planning on doing that deed is the rapist, as said before. Everyone else is there just to get drunk and party. \n\nNow, lets say, we take the person who will get raped out of the equation. Maybe they just went home so they could go to sleep early.\n\nWhat is the outcome? The rapist will just look for a different vulnerable person. I doubt they came to that party specifically for that person.\n\nNow, lets say the rapist is taken out of the situation. Maybe they just decided not to show up.\n\nNow, what is the outcome? No one gets raped.

Putin is outcast in civilized world, and he may do something dumb soon. I hope everything is going to be okay and we won't be forced to run\n\nUpdated: We're staying safe and calm, doing riutine things to keep the panic away, but we have most important stuff packed and ready to go in any time, waiting for traffic calm down, there're just so many cars, and infinite queues to gas stations\n\nUpdated 2: Everything is quiet here, nothing special happens, no explodes, everyone at school messenger group, discord, telegram discussing what they will do, some classmates were at supermarkets (I wasn't), it's just like black friday sales, but everyone try to buy products and other goods that will help. And roads. They are still filled with infinite number of cars...\n\nUpdated 3: russian drone was destroyed above our city\n\nUpdate 4: this happend guys, while I was having online lesson, dad interrupted and said that we're going NOW. We took everything that we packed and it might be last time we saw dad, my sister was crying and I... Somehow didn't even cry, I had no energy for it, I'm not even mad at Putin... I'm just disappointed that God created this guy, that supposed to be called \"human\", he's nothing, doesn't worth us being mad at him \u2014 it takes too many time for such shit. he destroyed my and 40 million other lifes...\nSuch a dick move\n\nUpdated 5: We did it, we crossed the boarder, just hour ago, we had to wait more than 24 hours in our car, and after all, we're traveling through north Romania and I even had to answer some questions to journalists: why do we leave, what do I think, what do we do now and etc... I answered all questions, cuz others(mother and sister) don't speak English well. We're planning to stay somewhere, to drink some tea in cafe or smth like that\n\nUpdated 6: We're still in Romania, visited a random gas station and met friends from our city in Ukraine. Talked with them, they went and we stayed for a while. We've driven about 500 kilometers, it's actually pretty exhausting by car, and we need to ride about 1000 kilometers more =(, but sights here are awosome, Karpatian mountains, so lame that we have no time for visiting Dracula's castle...\n\nUpdated 7: We found a nice place to spend night, owners are so kind, they made an amazing dinner =) We're setting off next morning, hoping for best.\nDumnezeu s\u0103 te aib\u0103 \u00een paz\u0103, Romania!\n\nUpdated 8: Goodmorning, it's 8:38 at Romania, we continue our way in a hour, lots of things happend during night, Military Forces of Ukraine are doing great, president staying at Kyiv, that's badass, I don't think russians have enough resources for fighting longer. Captured russian soldiers say, that they get orders to shoot civilian people, WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.\n\nUpdated 9: On our way we met some guys that stopped us near gas station, they tried to talk germam with, but ended up talking some kind of english, they gave us supplies! And know what, they gave us too much I think. 6 bottles of water... 2 big loaves of bread... Cans, sweets, it's too much, we actully didn't know what to do with it, but now I think it'll be fine for arriving to north Poland. God bless you, Romanian strangers!\n\nUpdating 10: Met some other Ukrainians, so we decided to give some of our food and water we got from strangers today, now we're near Ungarn boarders, now have to wait...\nEveryone are getting ready in our city for attack...\nOne of my homies is also going abroad, others went to different villages, and one of them has his traveling passport expired just before war, what should he do? Can he somehow leave Ukrain without traveling passport?\n\nEdited 11: It was a long time since last update, we've already left Hungary. Budapest is such a nice city, so many different architecture and sights, it was great to stay there\ud83d\udc4d We'd also tried to buy a ticket to London(We had choice to) but turned out that even refugees can't book a ticket without VISA:( So we continue our journey to our friends in Poland. There're also many videos of civilians taking down russians with bare hands and stealing russian vehicles, it makes me feeling so mixed, such chaos happening! Zelenskiy is badass as always, so happy of him being my president) \nBut those events at Kharkow... WHY? Why they shoot the civil buildings, they are not trying to demilitarise Ukraine or take the territory anymore, they are just killing all people they can, they fucking causing genocide, just killing Ukrainians, of course it was obvious at the beginning...\nWhat about homies that stayed at Ukraine... They seem to have fun making molotovs and traps for vehicles and not leaving abroad, I'm even a bit jealous of them. But still, it's pretty disturbing to stay there they say, that bombing could start in any time. Hoping for best for them.\n\nEdited 12: Yaay, we got to the finish :) our friends met us and we're staying with them for a week. So here's report for last two days: last hostel we stayed for a night was at Lodz' , it was kinda deppressive place and presence of creepy men there was a bit disturbing. However, what should've we expected from hotel for 800 Hrivnas (nearly 30$). We met there a woman from Kharkow. Her nephew died in a war and her house was totally destroyed, it was sad to hear that, she is such a nice person, she doesn't deserve that. We talked with her about news or anything else and then we continued or last dash to point B, we can now have a nice rest... \n\nAh yes, almost forgot, I'm not dead\ud83d\ude0e and none of my friends know about this post, don't belive that asshole\ud83d\udc4d I hope he won't spam his comment about my death in different communities. Love you all.\n\nEdited 13: Ugh, 2... Weeks... Later... We just stay in house, eat food, drink juice and water, throw trash, follow news, play Dota 2, nothing new, it's getting pretty boring, we're preparing for going to UK as refugees... Situation in Ukraine is quiet, nothing happens, is this going to end soon?\n\nNow I can see a huge difference between my first and latest updates, I lost enthusiasm and interest to environment, could it be a deppresion? However, don't deppressed people know that they are deppressed? Idk.\n\nStarted playing Metal Gear Rising recently, pretty fun game, that Samuel Rodrigues is such a nice guy, despite he's a villain and almost killed main charecter.\n\nEdit 14: since last update passed... A week? Or more, I actually stopped paying attention to time that runs so quick. We're still in Poland, stayed at cousine's home(She's ukr refugee too) and her two children. Pretty difficult children. They are really young, 3 and 5 years, but it's enough for they to find time for fighting and crying over lack of youtube, toys(they actually have a lot of toys), and sweets. The youngest, cries over everything, even if we admonit him about his little silly things he does. We have no WI-FI, only mobile internet, but it's enough to look through social media and text to friends.\n\nAfter 2-3 days, mom's driven back to Ukraine to help father with work, so basically there are me, my sister, cousine and her 2 children alone. \n\nWe don't do anything special, spend time listing news, and somehove entertain little children by going to park, where they can play on playground, but days're going really boring, can't wait until we fly to UK.\n\nEdit 15: 28th March. Mom will return in 3-4 days by bus, so we will travel now without our car, by train for example. \n\nI actually feel that 24th february was just yesterday, can't belive that whole month passed. I remember that first siren. So well. \n\nFor now, city where I live (Kamianets'-Podilskiy) still keeps calmness, except daily sirens, last time I was talking with father, our call interrupted a siren, so he had to go to basement. But still, our city wasn't bombed. Lviv was bombed recently, so I think russian army wants to not let ukrainian civilians to run to other countries.\n\nI was also surprised hearing that they started using phosphorus bombs. It was forbidden since WW1. It's terrifying weapon. People just die in agony after being affected by white phosphore burning, and it starts buring when it's surrounded by oxygen. It's inhumane.\n\nEdit 16: our UK refugee scheme applications were finally accepted, we are flying to London in 2 weeks. We returnet to our friends, left my cousine after helping her make applications for her and her children. I would really like to return to Ukraine, but even if war ends, father wants me to stay at UK to live there, because education in  Ukraine really crappy. He also may join us at England, but he has his work at Ukraine, and he wolud like to return home sometimes, is it possible sometimes go from UK to Ukraine and not cancelling refugee status? It's a question that's bothering us at the moment\n\nIt's gov.uk sponsorship scheme\n\nEdit 17: So here is another edit because I hadn't anything to say until today. We are actually fucking changed direction of our plan to 180\u00b0, we are returning to Ukraine. \nFirsteval, our father can't leave Ukraine, in army employment center said that he's ok to fight and can't go to UK with us. At, like, 5 days before setting off to UK father asked us to return, he can't hadle it, especially if he won't see us for few years completely, he would just go mad alone. Second, it would be really difficult to stay in England, because of a big distance from father, AND, what is important, it would be nonsens to look for a fine work vacancy as dentist in England, my mother graduated as dentist, but stomatology in that country, as we know, pretty weak. Also, our city wasn't affected by any shootings, because it's away from russia boarders. But now, if we still stay in Ukraine, I'll have much more things to tell you then if we would stay in far country.\n\nEdit 18: So we stay at our home, with whole family, and family of refugees from Kharkiv. We actually almost live usual life, except the sirens, that sound daily, we live pretty close to one of them. Not all friends are home, some of them in villages, or even abroad, because, people say that it's bad idea to return home before 9th May, because russia's dicktator has some plans for that date, he's even ready to use nuclear weapon. Anyway, if something *really* bad will happen, we have basement, where we can survive nuclear strike, but now, not even a single rocket hit our city\n\nEdit 19: 3rd May, a new wave of Z-ombies are coming, from Prendistrivie, it's btw 100 km from our city, but fact that they only have 1980's weaponry actually makes everything better. Today was a long one air alert, it lasted for few hours, and maybe it's still active. Enemy actually stopped bombing that actively, only tried to hit a hotel in Kyiv, were an United Nations participant was staying. Today me and dad saw a women that looked like Angelina Jolie, but weren't sure if it's her. Happy that civilians are successfully evacuated. So nothing we have to say tho.\n\nEdit 20: First of December, everything changed so much, idk what to say, we now have daily electricity showdown in every city, now everywhere we go we can hear growling sounds of generators, everything becomes so casual, just school, offline and online studying are mixed, now air raids appear only once every week, but they save rockets to make pointed attacks at power plants. However after all this time I now understand how fucking lucky we are to live in Kamianets'-Podilskyi, because we hadn't seen any rockets flying above us, while grandpa and grandma, who live in village like 20-30 km away hear and see them very close to the surface every single air raid. And still, there is a huge amount of folk that are in a much worse situation, I'm just writing a blog, but not experiencing any horrors of war...", ["This thread has been flaired as [Serious].

But I just wanted to stop by to remind you all of some things that I wish someone had told me growing up--", "You are likely not going to find a \"soulmate\" in high school or even college, don't fret, just focus on your studies, they're more important than you believe right now.\n\nRelationships are going to end, but that doesn't mean your life does. A boyfriend or girlfriend that doesn't work out is not the end of the world it's a learning experience. Even if it was a terrible breakup, and they cheated on you with your best friend or something (maybe even worse). Guess what, you just got the opportunity to cut TWO toxic fuckbags out of your life. FOR THE BETTER! Life goes on and I guarantee you that you will find someone that deserves your attention and effort and love. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point, don't try to please everyone, ESPECIALLY people in the same situation as you, ie. your peers. You don't need to be the most popular kid in your school, you don't need to impress anyone. As much as it may feel like everyone is watching you, they're worried about making the same mistakes as you. So you tripped on something and some dick heads laughed at you... So what, it's not the end of the world and I can promise you that they've made the same dumb mistakes too. PEOPLE FUCK UP. Everyone does stupid stuff and everyone gets laughed at for it, sure it may bring you some embarrassment or shame, but that's easily forgotten.\n\nAnd to my final point, because I feel like I'm just letting diarrhea spew out of my mouth hole at this juncture, (sorry, had a really bad day and a lot is on my mind), high-school is not your final destination. 4 years may seem like a lot, but it goes by quicker than you think and by the end of it, all of those dick heads, bullies, and horrible relationships will be stuck where they are. When you're done with school, you're done. You probably won't ever see those people again in your life, even if you're in the same town. It's amazing how big life gets after school. Don't give up, and for God's sake please don't let someone else foolish actions make you decide to end your own life. Life gets better after school because it becomes YOUR life. No more (classic) bullies, no more bullshit high-school drama filled half relationships, no teachers (professors in college are a whole different animal), and your stress level drops immensely.\n\nMy main point in this is that I keep seeing people younger and younger kill themselves over shit that really isn't as serious as it feels when you're young and your hormones are all sorts of out of whack. I've been there, I tried to kill myself several times in my life from 12 on after I lost my father, came really close twice. But I'm glad I didn't because I have an amazing daughter that makes life worth living. Life goes on, guys, and it does get better. One bad relationship, hell ten bad relationships isn't enough to end things, just breathe and believe in your future. Please don't end your life. You matter and you're important, and things get better.\n\nEdit- hey, everyone! Thanks for reading my message, I'm glad I could help some of you out.

While it\u2019s easy for the press to come out and say social media is bad because is drives up suicide rates, they don\u2019t really get a chance to live the life of the kid who was driven to kill themself. I think the real solution is to encourage mental and general support among kids. While the school I go to is involved in the kids lives. I think they need to slightly shift their focus from conflict resolution to helping kids in abusive families. Although I am straight myself, I have been told of a few depressing stories about teens being abused for coming out to their family. And while the school has a pride club it\u2019s really a dollar late and a dollar short. It seems to be too focused on keeping the peace between students. And not support for people in a genuine need for an outlet. It would be a good Idea for the counselors that we currently have to keep some of the shit they hear to themselves. Because in my mind they\u2019re the little elf on the shelf waiting for you to trip up so they can snitch on your ass to your parents. And if it already exists they should be more open about the available privacy. And I\u2019m guessing if that was true they would be. My point is. Suicidal kids are driven by more than just hormones.

At that age, it felt like every decision I had to make would define my life- unless you take up drugs, smoking cigarettes, or hurt yourself pretty badly, most likely the decision isn't permanent. (Drugs and other addictions aren't necessarily permanent, but you *really* don't want to deal with those.) Careers change, locations change, you won't necessarily get a job with your major, hell if you don't like your major you can change that too, basically you can switch stuff up later.\n\nThe stuff that you feel intensely emotional about now, you'll later learn that it's not worth it. The relationships and other experiences are new and profound, but over time you'll learn to deal with them better. \n\nYou think that the world makes no sense, so why don't adults just see these problems and FIX them?! Many jobs exist as long as the problems exist, that simple. Lots of money to be made from an illogical system. Politicians love inventing \"enemies\" for voters to get upset over, so they can claim to \"fight\" them and get votes. That sort of thing.\n\nBullies and idiots will still exist in the town and workplace, which I found to be very disappointing. Personality disorders will cause grown-ups to remain stuck at an immature level, so you just have to learn to deal with them (often avoidance is best if you can.) Don't waste time thinking those people will change, don't try making them happy, and don't expect too much, they'll have to figure it out themselves. \n\nIf you're in a dysfunctional family situation, focus on becoming financially and emotionally independent from them, and \"unplug\" yourself from their crazy dynamic for your own mental health- you don't owe them anything.\n\nDefinitely don't kill yourself- if I did that when I wanted to as a teen, I would've missed out on SO MUCH COOL SHIT, no joke.

Taking 5 AP\u2019s may look great on paper but that\u2019s about it. Take the classes you\u2019re comfortable with taking and which will give you the greatest chance at success. Getting an A- in \u201cregular calculus\u201d is far better looking (and feeling) than getting a C- in BC Calc and getting a 2 on the exam. Do your best to be realistic with yourself, and don\u2019t give in to pressure from parents, teachers or counselors who try to push you into AP or advanced classes if you\u2019re not ready. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what level classes you take as long as you are comfortable and do your best. It will make high school infinitely less stressful in the long run. \n\nAs you go into your junior and senior years, don\u2019t give into the narrative that applying to top-tier schools is what you should do. Your college experience is what you yourself get out of it, not what the institution offers. I dove headfirst into my education at a small state college, and had a great time socially and academically. Some of my friends who were \u201csmarter\u201d than me on paper went to places like Cornell and Dartmouth and had miserable times, but they went there because they thought they had to. \n\n\nAlso, trades. Don\u2019t be ashamed to enter the trade business. Plumbers make BANK. Construction workers, sanitation workers, auto mechanics - all necessary jobs and all good paying jobs.

But this group clearly has their own interests that don't involve your benefit.\n\nThe tricky thing with friends is that we have plenty of love and appreciation for them, and sometimes that same love can blind us to their bad behavior and the negative ways they affect our lives. It\u2019s important to know that these people are only looking for ways to hurt you for their own benefit.\n\nYou're in a toxic relationship with these people and you need to cut them off.

It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\n>As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\n>In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\n>Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\n>Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\n\nCredit goes to u/GSnow for writing this 8 years ago over on /r/Assistance", "http://abc7amarillo.com/news/local/17-year-old-amarillo-man-killed-after-wreck-on-loop-335-sw-9th-ave\n\nWas this him?", "Bro I know how u feel, 1 year ago my best friend also died, he was the same religion culture and his parents and my parents were from the same country.

I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.  \nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.  \n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.  \n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.  \n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.  \n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.", "The important thing to do is to try be happy in the future and have a good life because that would be what he would have wanted.

I didn't think much of it, since I'm used to seeing edgy 4chan shit online, but I decided to look to take a look at the account that posted it.\n\nWhen I opened the account, all I saw were two kinds of posts; posts about depression and suicide, and wildly antisemitic posts. I'm a Jew, so I felt a combined sense of confusion (almost to a humorous point) and anger at what I saw. I was planning on commenting angrily on all of his antisemitic posts, but then I had an idea.\n\nI remembered seeing a news story (still haven't found out if it's real or fake) about a black man who convinced hundreds of KKK members to leave the Klan by befriending them, and I wanted to see if I could replicate this. So, I kept the account in the back of my mind, periodically looking at his posts. One day, he put up a story asking if anyone wanted to be added to a groupchat to play Rainbow Six: Siege on PC. I decided to respond positively, so I could further my plan (and also because I really wanted to play R6 with someone).\n\nNow, from my posts, it was pretty evident that I'm Jewish, so the first thing he replied was \"ok Jew\". I knew he wouldn't add me to a groupchat just for that reason, but surprisingly, he did. We all started playing R6 together, and this guy seemed to treat me normally, but he never called me by my name. It was always \"Good kill, Jew\" or \"Get on Discord, Jew\".\n\nHowever, soon we grew closer, to the point where he shouted me out on his account, calling me \"the one good Jew to be born\". But I could tell that was always his sole impression of me. He only really identified me by my religion. I could also tell from his posts about depression that he likely suffered from it.\n\nThen one day, at around 11:30 PM, as I was about to get off Instagram and go to sleep, I saw a new post from him. The photo was just some weird dark lo-fi art, and all the caption said was \"Killing myself, see you guys\".\n\nImmediately, I got scared and instinctively began typing a message to him in his DMs. I thought it may all be in vain, and that he had maybe already done it. But I just couldn't stop typing. I couldn't bear to see another person die a needless death to depression, even if they didn't like my people. I don't wanna talk in specifics about what I said (it's very tough for me to write this now), but I concluded by telling him that, if his life didn't matter and nobody cared about him, why would a Jew, 300 miles away and 3 years younger (he's 19 I'm 16) even be trying to save his life.\n\nAfter a rough night of sleep, I woke up and fearfully checked my DMs. All I saw from him was a photo and a message. The photo was just him smiling and doing a thumbs-up. In the message, he once again did not call me by my name. However, he didn't call me \"Jew\" either. All his message said was \"Thanks friend\".\n\nHe's now doing way better. He's since deleted all of his antisemitic posts, and we now like to discuss history and politics together (and of course play R6). He met his girlfriend soon after, who he is still with. And two days ago, he finally got his dream job: a designer for a small tabletop RPG company.\n\nWhen confronted with hate on the internet, too many people let their emotions take control, and start flaming each other. Next time you see someone spreading prejudice online, even against a group that you are part of, do not fall into this habit. Instead, I challenge you to talk to them, and try to understand what they may be going through. You might change their mind, you might make a friend, and you might even save a life.\n\nEDIT: Thank you kind stranger front page RIP inbox yadda yadda in all seriousness I love you guys and I really hope that you guys respond to hatred with kindness\ud83d\udc4d", ["Now this is why you should max out your charisma", "Treat hate with kindness and you can get more kindness", "Good shit dude\nGood shit", "I wish I could upvote twice but take a silver", "that was very cash money of you", "Here ya go kiddo.

You are not your disorder.** I believe you are a human.\n\n* **Don\u2019t be afraid to have a conversation or to seek professional help.** Be honest and kinder to yourself and those around you, your body and mind will be grateful for it.\n\nSee you later nerds.", ["Thank you old man, see you in the afterlife", "[deleted]", "I have a tip you missed out: just pick the OLD flair.", "This is golden.

But I have a relevant thought:\n\n**Don\u2019t send those nudes.** You probably already know this, but there\u2019s a lot of pedos pretending to be \u201cfellow kids.\u201d Sending nudes while you\u2019re a minor can put you in trouble.  Hell, having your own nudes of when you were a minor is in a grey legal area, as most child pornography laws do not require a state of mind: simply having them is the crime. Consent to have them is not relevant. Law enforcement also has this like, \u201cit\u2019s child porn, arrest everyone\u201d mentality\u2014which is the right mentality to have. But it sometimes loops in the children-now-adults, which sucks. \n\nYou asked why they don\u2019t just look up all the free porn. When another kid is asking for your nudes, what they really want is your validation and attention. You can give that without nudes. When you balance the risk/reward of creating/sending nudes vs. the joy it creates, I think you\u2019ll find that something like an audio message of a kiss or something just as validating (but not pornographic) is a better way to go. \n\nHave a wonderful, healthy, safe life.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nLost Internet Stranger", "When I was 13 smartphones didn\u2019t exist, and if you wanted naked photos you\u2019d have to develop them yourself.

Nobody has the right to ask for nudes even if they claim to be \u201ca minor\u201d too. You\u2019re 13. People are disgusting. Who ask a 12 year old for tit picks. I will never understand people.", "I\u2019ve never asked for nudes and I\u2019m pretty proud of it.

As a guy who was bullied & molested by some guys, I feel that pedos, sick men, teens & men who are completely blinded by lust should not live at all. \n\nWe are all humans with conscience but there are some who see women ( of any age ) as a piece of object and nothing more. They think that asking for nudes or sexually advancing is nothing but a piece of cake. IT IS NOT RIGHT AT ALL ! Everyone has their own personal space ( or comfort zones ). With a stranger, you may not feel that comfortable standing close. With a friend, you may/may not stand that close. With the besties, you may stand close. With the person who you really love ( fiance/bf/gf ), you will be comfortable enough to be naked. But some filthy people just cross that space and ask for nudes/ touch inappropriately/ molest. \n\nImagine that a girl whom you don't know at all and is approaching you ( You as Guy ). Then suddenly asks for your dick or touch you inappropriately or tries to molest you. I bet some filthy people will think as a dream come true. The reality is that either your whole mind will freeze out there and you will be traumatized with that incident. OR try to back it away with difficulty and get traumatized with that. \n\nNow think yourself as a girl and imagine how many creepy DMs she might have got. Think of the creepy look that many guys give to the girls. Think of those creepy guys who think women as a piece of sex object and nothing more. I bet you every girl will be boiling with anger & frustration whenever they encounter these kinds of situation. The amount of mistreatment that they face is just outrageous. If I were a girl, then probably I would have hated to interact with anyone at all or I would have that murderous intent to end that creep's life.  \n\nThere are many teens ( both gender ) who get traumatized by that and unfortunately take their own lives ( One of my close friend took her own life because she was molested & I was also thinking of that too ). And there are many who overcome that and become more stronger but that scar always live in the memory.  \n\nSo everyone whoever is reading this, promise to yourself that if you see someone getting harrased, just defend that person and make sure that the molester is punished. If you find a creepy DMs, take a screenshot or save it & show that as an evidence to the Police/FBI/Cyber Police and also mention that to your parents so that they can help/assist/morally support you for arresting that creep. Don't just block and move on because if they failed getting you, then will move on to some other women. Don't let that crime to continue. Take fighting lessons. That will help you when needed. Keep some equipments that will deter creeps from trying to molest. If required, kill ( although injuring to the point where they won't move is better ). Always be vigilant to the surroundings. And finally, DON'T BE A CREEP in the first place ( to all creepy men out there ).\n\nTo all those filthy people, think of those who are close to you. If someone does something horrible to them, will you stay happy ? What about your mom/sister/gf ? Will they feel good that they were molested ? No. They will be devastated. Your blood will boil. Think again. God always gives second chance to correct yourself. Don't miss the only chance to correct yourself if you are in that position. Because, you are no longer a human in the eyes of God. \n\n...", "Came here from browsing /r/all and I just wanted to say that its most likely not boys asking for that.

I had offered to change my interests and possibly personality to better suit them, to which they called me toxic, probably for good reason. (That was a few nights before last). I started tearing up and they could definitely tell, but before I let the floodgates out (and if anyone has seen a teen guy cry, you\u2019d know it\u2019s not very often.) I just walked off, head down shoulders in from the pain I was in. I didn\u2019t look back, I was too concentrated on not crying in public. I finally got to a forest trail and sat on a stepping stone and cried my heart out. It\u2019s definitely the only time I\u2019ve ever cried over a significant other (to be fair they were my first serious girlfriend (of ten months)). I just sat there for the 40 minutes it took for my dad to get to me, crying every so often. If I could have hugged them for the last time (keep in mind the last time I actually physically hugged them was in March before covid), I would have jumped at that chance. I\u2019ve been coping fairly well, of course that first day from about 4 pm til 11 pm really was difficult to get through, I cried more times than I\u2019d like to admit. I really know who my true friends are, and I\u2019ve distanced myself from my ex girlfriend and that friend group. A few honorable mentions are Sam, Alex and Bella. Those are the few people who have actually showed signs that they cared, not just the \u2018im so sorry\u2019 that everyone else said. It felt nice, yes but after a while it just was falling on deaf ears. Are you really sorry, person who I barely talk to at all? Sam told me to go be the bad bitch that I was, and to focus on self care a lot. Alex gave me advice on how to deal with how I was feeling, to sink any anger or sadness into a hobby, mine for example is running and cosplay. Alex\u2019s was art. Bella? Well, Bella just kept checking in on me every so often. Do I regret anything that I\u2019ve said to my ex? Yes and no. I misgendered them I think twice that day, which really wasn\u2019t smart of me to do but it was in a friendly way by saying \u2018yooo dudeee look at that kid\u2019 or something along those lines, but I don\u2019t think they really understood that. \n\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my spiel.

Just today, some lady came to our door telling us that somebody made a complaint about my cats and I have a week to get rid of them :(\nI've had these cats for years and nobody's made a complaint about them.

But I can\u2019t help but to feel like I don\u2019t know what the actual fuck I\u2019m gonna do with my life. I don\u2019t have any idea what to do except work and work and work. That\u2019s all I\u2019m doing at the moment and it sucks ass. I feel like everybody else has it better than me, or at least had their life figured out. I feel like everything I do just doesn\u2019t have any meaning to it. I try to make other people happy or at least have them enjoy my company, but I feel like it\u2019s the total opposite. I\u2019ve thought about how if I ever die no one will have anything to remember me for. No pictures or memories because I rarely go out and barely have any friends. All I\u2019ve got are some stupid ass poems I write every now and then, but that\u2019s it. I feel like nobody else desires to have me in their life. And honestly, I couldn\u2019t blame them. But, I don\u2019t know I feel so lost and afraid. I\u2019d rather indulge myself in video games and live in the fantasy worlds and thrilling adventures they offer. At least that way I know what I\u2019m doing. They tell me where to go and how to do it. They give you the necessary materials you need to keep going, to keep fighting. All in all, I\u2019m dissatisfied with my life. I know I\u2019m young and still have a lifetime ahead, but at this point I don\u2019t even know I\u2019m going to be in a better place. I\u2019d rather not know. But thank you OP, I really needed that.", "So um this is an old post and litteraly no one is gonna look at this but I do need a hug :/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo right now, I doubt anyone would even read this comment, but because it's anonymous, I would like to rant about my situation so that I can finally let it all out. My parents are going through some hardships and I feel like my dad has a girlfriend already, even tho he's already married and has two kids, me and my younger sister. I always was mad about that and never noticed the very big red flags. He always hid his phone, had a password not even my mom knows, and blames my mom for everything. \n           Aside from that, they'd always fight for small things and throught out the years, I started to think, well what if it's actually him doing this on purpose, to have a reason to leave my mom. He would also get jealous when my mom was even \ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde5 a man. Yet he would talk to other women and my mom would be just fine. He has always been a drinker and would go out and drink with his friends, but never alone or just because so I never thought much of it. But he started to  drink almost every week this year and hanging out with his \"friends\" more often that he would come back home at like 1 in the morning.\n               When we questioned him, he just smiled and said \"oh just a friend\" but never said who. Instead of getting mad, my naive self thought every night \"oh well is he ok, I hope he sleeps with his friends instead of drunk driving, I hope he's sleeping by now.\" This girl so bad that he spent the whole day and night with them and dint comeback home till 1 in the afternoon. \n              \ud835\udde1\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude04 \ud835\uddf6

It\u2019s not right. \n\nI won\u2019t pretend that I know what you\u2019re going through; I\u2019m not a member of the black community and I realize I can\u2019t begin to understand. \nI\u2019m not a US citizen; I live in a small multi-racial country that has not had to deal with racial riots or police brutality near since our independence, so I won\u2019t pretend to understand how Americans are feeling right now... but watching all this happen makes me feel hurt, angry, sad and sick that for all the loss of lives and all the protests and riots, nothing has changed. \n\nThe world needs to do better so that young men like you can live freely and safely, and have the same securities and peace of mind that the rest of us take for granted. \n\nTL;DR I guess I\u2019m trying to say that the rest of the world watching this happen stands with you, and you are not alone. I hope all this will end in some real change so that you don\u2019t have to be afraid like this, ever again.

This is the most moving thing I've ever read about grief and I hope it can bring you some comfort. https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/bf5mxh/_/elb7ib8?context=1000\n\n\n> Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents. \n\n> I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see. \n\n> As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive. \n\n> In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. \n\n> Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. \n\n> Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves.

It gets worse before it gets better, and the full force of the loss might not come to you until farther down the road. Regardless, you're not alone in this. My advice? Feel everything. I mean that. When you feel sad, be sad. When you feel happy, be happy. It's a vicious cycle of good days and bad days, until they all just blend into days, and a feeling of content settles in. \n\nFreshman year, my school psychologist walked me through the stages of grief, which I'm sure you've at least heard of. Something he explained to me that never really left my head is how it's not a straight path. You don't just go down the line and check-list from denial to acceptance, and never experience it again. You might bounce between bargaining, denial, anger, even after you've crossed acceptance off, and ask yourself *why?* Emotions aren't some well-structured set of rules; they're abstract. They're conscious of pain, and react violently, without thought. That's nothing to be ashamed of, especially not with what you're probably going through right now.\n\nDon't push yourself to get to the end, and don't beat yourself up on the days you wonder why you're having a hard time moving on. People always sing praise to mothers and the impact they have on their children's lives (Which they should; mothers are amazing) But, as someone who spent age thirteen and up with nothing but a father, I can only assume the anguish behind losing yours. It's devastating, and I'm sorry for your loss. Most-everyone will have to say goodbye to their parents at some point, but as a *kid?* It's cruel and unfair, and completely alright to be angry about all this stolen time; something as simple as sitting in each other's presence.\n\nI recommend watching [My Brother Jordan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryEq5Yov2G0). It's not some self-help on how to move on from grief, and it's not meant to distract you from the pain. Sometimes all mourning needs is a second voice to mirror your own, and that's exactly what I feel this video does. It's happy, it's sad, it's angry, and it's inconclusive, much like life. I'm not sure what else to say, otherwise. I hope you're doing well.", "I'm really sorry, it sounds like he had a wonderful life.

I still miss him even after 1 year+ it just isnt something you can easily shake off.\n\nOn the day of his death I was at home while he and mom were at the hospital to do dialysis, he called and texted to check up on me on whether or not I was ready to head out for school, I wasnt able to respond since I didnt see it and I was just about to skip school that day.

Some people out there are very, very skilled at what they do. It can seem absurd at some times to think that the person chatting you up could possibly have malicious intentions.

Never give out any identifying information to anyone, even if they say they\u2019re the same age, the gender you\u2019re interested in, from a seemingly far away or innocent place. It\u2019s all too easy to lie, and the smallest pieces of information can have dire consequences. You shouldn\u2019t be afraid to explore the internet, but always keep in mind that there are people that can and would hurt you if given the chance. If you feel uncomfortable or threatened at any point, please talk to a trusted adult. It can be a parent, an older sibling, a religious figure, a teacher, or even an officer. No responsible adult is going to brush off your concerns, and if they do, you\u2019ll be able to find another one that won\u2019t. Oftentimes your concerns won\u2019t amount to anything serious, however, that is no reason to not take them seriously and give them some contemplation. Finally, please remember that older people (such as an 18 year old) has no business whatsoever in attempting to make inappropriate conversation with younger people (such as 14 year old). They can absolutely contribute to healthy discussions (such as relaying reassurances and advice to younger redditors about different parts of growing up), but under no circumstances should you tolerate them attempting anything more sexual/\u2018romantic\u2019.

And \u2018mature for your age\u2019 is an attempt to flatter you and get you to think of yourself as being older and more experienced than you really are. It\u2019s all a manipulation tactic meant to get you to do what they want. Stay safe, and don\u2019t give the time of day to these creeps.

You weren't supposed to do anything. Not a goddamn thing. My little girl is only 4 (I have older sons), but I'm almost sure I know why I would do something like that in ten years.\n\nFirst, as a dad, I have my number one rule when it comes to my teenage daughter. Embarrass the mess out of her. My clothes will not be stylish. My singing will be awful. If there is music on, you best believe I will be dancing. Cute boy? I'm trying to get his attention. Why? Because there is a certain bond that comes from this interaction with your kids that you won't understand until you're there. This is one of those unwritten dad rules that no one is ever taught, but somehow everyone knows (like checking to see if the stud detector works). I'm sure dad didn't whisper this to you and his daughter heard it. You best believe she complained when they got in the car and he smiled like a fool the whole ride home. That interaction was for him.\n\nThe second reason is a little more discreet. As a teenage boy, life is hard. You have no idea where you place is in this world and there's not a lot out there to help you find it. Most times you won't be sure of yourself. You'll be trying to figure out if you're doing the right thing or the cool thing or just any thing that is worth doing. You're going to see all these cool guys on tv that the girls fawn over and you're going to want to be that. You won't be that, though. That girl you like will walk in the gym right as you airball that three pointer. Everybody will sing and song and you don't know the words. You don't have abs like that guy on Instagram. You'll try a haircut and it'll end up as a disaster. There's a lot of hits you'll take and you won't have the perspective that they don't really matter in the big scheme of things. You will focus on those losses, and we don't get many wins. This dad was trying to give you a win. I assure you, this dad thinks his daughter is a catch, and she thinks YOU'RE cute. YOU. You're that guy. Stud. Chad. Whatever the kids say now. You're him. Smile that smile. Feel that ego boost. That dad was giving you a gift, one that we don't get very often.

If you bring this up to somebody who doesn't understand, don't give up like I did. Sorry for this long story but I think it's very relevant to you: I am very tall (204cm/6'9) and I look a bit like Tarzan. I had drunk ladies grab my ass and crotch when I was out with friends, a lot. It still happens but I deal with it differently today. Whenever it happened and I told my friends about it they all said \"What, you can't just fight them off?\". Yes, I could physically remove their hands, but I really shouldn't have to. Nobody took my complaints seriously so I stopped complaining. It made me feel like a piece of meat, it fucked with my head a lot. When I was 28 my friend's girlfriend said something along the lines of \"damn you have worked out a lot recently\" and put her hands under my shirt to feel my stomach. My friend went through the roof as expected, but he was only angry at her because he was jealous. Her friends defended her by saying she didn't mean anything she was just curious. Whilst they were arguing, I realized nobody gave a shit if I consented or not. When I said I wasn't cool with it, they seemed surprised, they couldn't understand why I cared. I pointed out that if genders were reversed there would be an outrage, but they said it's different. Why? Because I am part of the \"stronger\" gender and I should take it as a compliment... that kind of behaviour is sadly enabled by a lot of movies. Media tells us sexual assault is a one-way street, but it's really not. For 10 years I just let it slide, but that moment was an eye-opener, I am no longer friends with those idiots. Today at age 30 if it happens to me I make a big scene and make sure they are thrown out of the club. I make sure they are punished just like any guy would be punished, well I don't beat them up, but I make sure they feel ashamed of what they did. Society is getting more and more aware of this issue, but the change is slow and there will be plenty of jackasses out there telling you to \"just enjoy it\" or \"why are you complaining? she is hot!\". These people are scum and haven't adjusted to 2019. Even if you feel like it's embarrassing to call them out, in the long run it will make you feel so much better about yourself. You have the right to decide who touches you. Talk to an adult at your school, if that person doesn't take you seriously, try the next one. Don't give up like I did. Don't wait. I wish someone told me this at 15, it would have saved me a lot of headaches. You don't have to accept this behaviour from anyone, if necessary get police involved.

Write down all your bills (other than rent) such as phone, internet, electricity, car insurance etc. These will all be billed at different intervals so break them down into weeks.\n\n>E.g. if your internet is $40 per month, that\u2019s roughly $10 per week.\n\nOnce all of your bills are in weeks, add them up to figure out how much money you need to put aside per week to pay them. If you are paid weekly, great! Put that amount aside in a bank account called *\\_BILLS\\_* as soon as you get paid. If you are paid fortnightly, double it and do the same thing. It\u2019s not rocket science, but it works.\n\n2. Rent! No one wants to be homeless, so this is pretty damn important. Honestly, I should move it to #1 but I\u2019m lazy.\n\nSame as *BILLS*, put this aside in a bank account called *RENT* as soon as you are paid. If you are paid weekly, put one week\u2019s worth aside. If you are paid fortnightly, put two weeks worth aside. You get the picture.\n\nNote: there is an added bonus to doing it like this. If your landlord ever tries to say you missed a payment, you have all of your dated transactions in one easily searchable account. One of my landlords once lost a week of my rent and tried to bill me for it a second time. With good records you can tell them to ~~go fuck themselves~~ take a hike.\n\nFor both *RENT* and *BILLS* use automatic transfers or direct debits where possible. They make life easier, save time, and you\u2019ll never miss a payment.\n\n*Money Part 2: Electric Boogaloo*\n\nNow that you\u2019ve done that, you have an idea of what\u2019s left over after you get paid. We aren\u2019t done yet though. You don\u2019t have a savings account or an \u201coh fuck\u201d account. Let\u2019s fix that.\n\n3. Oh, fuck: your crazy housemate pissed in the fridge, slashed your tyres, and what\u2019s worse, drank your milk without replacing it. Jokes on them though, you pissed in the milk first. Still, what an asshole.\n\nHowever it happens, sometimes shit just goes wrong. That\u2019s when you need an *Oh, Fuck*^(TM) account.\n\nLook at any weekly expenses you have left, these will most likely be groceries and petrol/gas plus a few other random things. Total those up and use them as a baseline to give yourself a weekly \u201cwage\u201d. Anything above this, put into your *Oh Fuck* account until you have enough to last a couple of months if shit really hits the fan.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve done that, never touch this account unless you really bloody well have to. Have it with a different bank if necessary, and definitely do not have a card linked to it. This is your lifeline, don\u2019t waste it on a bloody sofa (or a clean one, for that matter).\n\n4. You thought we were done? Haha, nah fam. Being an adult is long and tedious. Next up is *SAVINGS*. Once you have gotten your *Oh Fuck* account to an acceptable level start putting most of your excess here instead. This is the account you will use for new shoes & clothes (you fucking Diva) or luxuries like entertainment and other non essential items.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to spend from this account where necessary, but for any bigger purchases wait a week or so and see if you still want it. People have shit judgement when they impulse buy, and statistically you and I are no different. Yay?\n\n5. General Account: this is the account you get paid into, and the account you weep over as you transfer away bills, rent, savings, and *Oh Fuck* money. The only money you want in here is your weekly wage (mentioned above). If you don\u2019t get paid weekly and tend to eat into next week\u2019s wage, consider keeping next week\u2019s wage in your savings account until the new week. Anything left over at the end of the pay cycle should be moved to Savings or *Oh Fuck* depending on what you\u2019re trying to build up.\n\n7. Bonus: this isn\u2019t a big one, but I like it. Every time you want to order takeaway, cook instead and earmark the money you would have spent as guilt free **you** money. It adds up surprisingly quickly and you can use it to buy things that you\u2019ll enjoy more in the long term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***How to cook (properly):***\n\nThis one should be obvious, but eating out is really expensive long term. If your parents are any good at cooking, ask them to teach you before you move out. The earlier the better, trust me. I was half decent, but I wish I\u2019d learned a lot more.\n\nIf they aren\u2019t, the internet is an amazing resource. I recommend buying one GOOD knife rather than a set of knives and some stainless steel pots. Treat them well and they will last you forever. Non stick are convenient, but you can say goodbye if a metal utensil even looks at them funny. Hot oil in a hot stainless steel pan = non stick anyway.\n\nGeneral cooking tips:-Onions and garlic are you friends, they are cheap but make things taste less poor.\n\n* Frozen vegetables are just as nutritious as fresh ones and don\u2019t turn into a pile of slush at the back of your fridge if you forget about them.\n* Fuck instant noodles, they aren\u2019t as cheap as you think they are. Memes aside, they aren\u2019t worth it.\n* Rice is cheap in 5kg sacks and lasts you ages. Use two cups of water for every one cup of rice. Bring it to the boil, then turn the stove off and forget about it for 20 minutes with a lid on. Bam, perfect fucking rice every fucking time.\n* Eggs are a godsend. Cheap, filling, and really damn good for you. Eat when possible.\n* Canned beans (eg kidney beans) are also a godsend. Cheap as hell, and you can add them to things like curries or pasta sauce to add protean and bulk them out.\n* Spices are literally the spice of life. Get a whole bunch and never look back.\n* You can buy big cheap bottles of pasta sauce for less than $2 and make them nice by frying some onion and garlic first and cooking some veggies and beans in them for a while.\n* Make big meals and freeze the extras if you have space. It really helps on the days you\u2019re exhausted by life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***No one cares about you (and that\u2019s a good thing)***\n\nHear me out here. I was so self conscious when I first moved out of home that I was terrified of looking like an idiot. I never had a dad so I put off buying fucking shaving cream and a razor in case I got the \u201cwrong(?)\u201d ones and the clerk thought I was stupid or something. Speaking to my female friends, they detailed similar stories about buying feminine hygiene essentials. Plot twist: outside of a few friends and family members no one gives a shit about you. The Clerk will forget you exist after about five minutes, and if your friends give you crap you can just get better friends.\n\nI know this one is easier said than done, but try and keep things in perspective. What\u2019s the worst that could happen? Usually it\u2019s actually nothing. They don\u2019t care if you buy shaving cream or pads, and if someone thinks you look weird crawling around for a good photo, fuck em. Your photos are probably better than theirs anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo uh, yeah, that\u2019s it. Those are the three things I wish I\u2019d known before getting kicked out of home: no one cares about you, cooking is good (and might even land you a girlfriend/boyfriend), and managing money is important. Who\u2019da thunk it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edits:** \n\nI'm really glad this seems to be reaching the people who need it, or will need it. I just came back to 300+ comments so do forgive me for answering some common questions here:\n\n>Where are you from? \n\nHere I was thinking that all the swearing would have given me away. Maybe I should have said brah or cunt, but I tend to avoid the latter since it is an absolute cunt of a word. Anyway, If you ask that I'll have to hand you a Vegemite sandwich. Don't tempt me, its a national sport for us.\n\n>Are you doing better now? \n\nYes, thanks for asking! I completed my university studies mid this year whereupon I graduated into a global pandemic. Or didn't, since we weren't allowed to have graduations... Still, I'm proud of myself.\n\n>How will cooking get me a girlfriend/boyfriend?\n\nWorked for me. I had a housemate going through hard times so I always \"accidentally\" cooked extra so she could have some. She knew I was full of it of course, and she still does. Worst comes to worst, you can have a nice meal to cry alone over ~~just like old times~~. Basically, no warranties, guarantees or batteries included with this one.\n\n>Can I share this?\n\nBy all means, I wrote this to help people so feel free to spread my profanity far and wide.", ["\u201cJokes on them though, you pissed in the milk first\u201d\n\n11/10", "You are a godsend, the world needs more people like you.", "sorry people in the comments are being so rude, thank you for making this post, it\u2019s highly useful", "I am saving this post for when I turn 18 along with\nFree things on the internet\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hsirrq/what_is_something_free_from_the_internet_everyone/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share", "I know nothing about financial literacy Imao", "I think 1 thing is missing.

A couch is always safer than a bench. If you have to absolutely kiss someone's ass to crash on their couch for a few days, do it. Sleeping in a bench gets you kidnapped or worse.\n\n2.) QT has a safe house. If you tell them you're in trouble they have a safe room the vast majority of the time. Always know where the nearest QT is.\n\n3.) Travel on main streets by foot. Don't do alleys or residential roads. \n\n4.) A knife does nothing if you don't know how to use it. I'm 90 lbs and very short. If you're like me, you can't stab someone. Get GEL pepper spray. Others blow back in the wind. Invest in gel. \n\n\n\n**MEAL PLANS**\n\n1.) Always have a list. Never enter a store without a list and a budget. The majority of large grocery chains have apps you can use to create a list. There are tax calculators online. \n\n2.) Cook for two days. I always cook for at least two days. Dinner always becomes lunch the next. It's super convenient.\n\n3.) Vegetables are almost always cheaper than meat. Learn to love salad. Also, if you shop every week with a meal plan, you can usually buy fresh veggies.\n\n4.) Easy meals:\n\n- Chicken and dumplings is a go to.\n\n- Spaghetti is absurdly easy and can be made into fried Spaghetti the next day. Fry the noodles in a bit of butter and it makes it almost better.\n\n- Pesto on noodles. Super cheap and super light. I like to use the cute little bow ties. Keep the sauce separate when refrigerated for lunch.\n\n- Poor man's breakfast. Not sure if this is the actual name but it's tortilla soaked in egg and shallow fried. Absurdly good even though I hate eggs. \n\n- Bread. Make your own bread. You won't regret it. You can make dessert breads too with some honey and sugar; it can be a good pick me up for poors\n\n\n\n**TAXES**\n\n1.) Don't pay turbotax. If I recall, fuckturbotax.com has some free filing options.\n\n2.) Assume everything is taxed. If anything is on the books, set aside at least a 5th of it (I'm assuming y'all are as broke as me) for taxes if you don't have a bank account\n\n\n\n**MONEY**\n\n1.) I was kicked out and kept from getting a job or a bank account before them. I still have no way to transfer money other than a paypal because I have to wait until I'm a legal adult. On this end, if you have an older friend, you can usually paypal them for cash for groceries. Don't be too shy to ask.\n\n2.) Buy nothing first hand.

Investing you money properly is the difference between retiring at 45 happy and well or at 65 debt ridden and stressed. Basic idea is that you set up a direct deposit into a trading account and every month invest 10% of your income into investments. Yes 10%. In fact 10% should be the bare minimum or at least 200$ a month. If you don\u2019t have the money, that\u2019s fine, you can start with as little as a buck and you can save through many ways:\n\nLook at you monthly expenses every month and seek the best price: \n- if you\u2019re paying 260 for cable, search and you\u2019ll surly find a better deal at 230. Although this doesn\u2019t look like much, 30 bucks is huge over 30+ years with compound interest (investing). \n- insurance: look at whether you\u2019re paying a best price for your car insurance or anything else. \n- cut out any unnecessary spendings and invest that stuff. \n\nLook, this post barely scratched the surface of investing for retirement and you guys shouldn\u2019t really trust a random post like myself but really, read some books. Even if you only read half of them, it\u2019ll be good for you. \n\nrecommendations:\nretire before mom and dad by rob berger\nAnd any other financial book (sorry I\u2019m on mobile and I don\u2019t really feel like writing the books I have read) \n\nAlthough this post will get buried, I hope it helps someone.

Usually you can get their old stuff if you move their new stuff into their house. It is usually a good deal and granny might even throw in a glass of lemonade for helping her out. (Be careful, old washing machines are way heavier than the new ones)\n\n\\-Keep your eye out for local news that tell you if there is a local trash day. The waste will be out the night before, than you can become a trash burglar.\n\n\\-A lot of kitchen utensils can be bought / found / salvaged when old folks have to go to the old folks home. Try to jump in and buy stuff for cheap.\n\n\\-If you are really desperate, some governmental trash dumps even let you take stuff if you ask nice enough. With a small bribe of a beer and a friendly chat with the local garbageman you might find out which of that stuff still works\n\n\\-A somewhat unconventional but very successful method is to camp outside of a trash dump where local people can dump their own electronic waste. Hold up a sign that says \"need working appliance X, willing to give Y\". You will exchange a good functioning machine for a good chunk of your pride.\n\n**Cooking:**\n\n\\-It is not a good idea to get the really cheap stuff, especially if that means that you will substitute (somewhat healthy) oil with oil that was made for deep frying (and is super unhealthy)\n\n\\-the microwave is a horrible thing and should never be trusted! That being said, it is useful to warm up coffee or make potatoes. You shouldn't get one tough. Not really worth it\n\n\\-never go for the frozen dinner-to-eat option first, it is usually either less nutritious or more costly\n\n\\-canned or frozen vegetables are fine tough, they are usually cheaper than if you buy fresh\n\n\\-If you can buy directly from the farmer, this might be way cheaper\n\n\\-Don't go to the farmers market tough, those are usually way more costly due to all the hipsters paying virtually all their money for a wired caped lettuce\n\n\\-Growing your own herbs can be a good option\n\n\\-never eat something too much! You can get a special kind of food poisoning from eating too much eggs and you can develop allergies from exclusively eating only one thing\n\n\\-In some countries (like Germany) meat is somehow cheaper than fresh vegetables. That is wired but useful. Meat can give you a lot of protein. Don't expect too much tough, most of that stuff will be water and sadness. Still might be worth it tough.\n\n\\-If you have time at your hands it is very useful to go foraging. In many places you can get nuts (chestnuts make a very tasty full meal), herbs (sorrel,  nettle, spinach), fruits (be aware of the deadly belladonna which looks like a tasty cherry but is dangerous to humans but not animals) or mushrooms. Be very, very careful with mushrooms since they might be poisonous! Most towns have some club that will help you identify them tough. **If you have one poison mushroom in your basket throw it all away!** Including the basket! Be very careful if you live near old industry, the herbs might be a bit poisonous.\n\n\\-You can go fishing if your nanny state allows you to do so. If you can it might be a good hobby that gives you very tasty food. Be very careful of industrial pollution tough, fishes soak them up like mushrooms or herbs do.\n\n\\-In some places you might even be allowed to hunt (US, Switzerland). If you have a lot of time this is a good way to earn a few bucks extra while doing sports. Provided you have a rifle tough (if you need one, I found usable 50 $ bargain bin rifles at garage sales back in the day, be careful to double check that it is legal to make the deal in that area) and you know what you are doing.\n\n**Leisure time:**\n\n\\-try to do something that allows you to connect with people. Especially if you live in a small town. This might mean sports, church or the local town meeting. Try to show the town that you are a decent person. Try to connect especially with people who are older/more successful than you. You never knew if that guy you go playing basketball once a week might hire you some day. I know that this might sound slimy but you do not need to brown nose. All you need to do is just pop on their radar once or twice. You basically just need to show them that you are living in the town/area, that you are a normal person. This will make it much easier if they have to deiced whether they want to heir you or some other bloke.\n\n\\-avoid bars, casinos, arcades (ok, they gone mostly the way of the Dodo) and all places where you personally know that you blow your money\n\n\\-if you are looking for a partner they might be unavoidable tough\n\n\\-the beach is great since it is free and you can meet pretty ladies / boys\n\n\\-if you want to get a TV, there are cheap options that 10 years ago where the Bee's Knees and can now be bought used for about 20-50 $. Go for an old flagship instead a new cheap one if you know that the thing **still works**\n\n\\-if you need a computer than a ryzen 3 gaming system can be had for about 500 $ - 750 $. It will be serviceable, ask on reedit before you buy the parts tough. I still recommend to salvage old parts for \\~100 $ and build yourself an ancient giant together. Allfather Youtube will teach you how. Might be not enough to run the latest AAA title. But you do not have 60 $ for the latest title, don't you? So go for cheap indie games that are just as fun and run on a toaster. I recommend everything with good steam ratings that cost under 5 $. Also Dwarf Forrest, Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead or Space Station 13 are free.", "A big one for me when shit hit the fan with my abusive mother a couple days before I'd have to break the lease because my old roommate moved out with a week and a half before rent due when I had moved across state lines to rent with them...\n\nThe friends and family who treat you right, RECIPROCATE. I was just as guilty of losing friends because I took them for granted as I was losing people who were toxic waste dumps of human beings. Yes, you may be going through incredibly rough times. But so do other people. Ask what their boundaries are and respect them. I have a friend I can't talk to about being suicidal since a family member of theirs committed suicide.\n\nI know it's scary but professional help is there for a reason. Don't put all your baggage onto your friends and NEVER blame them when you are struggling if they are genuinely trying to help. No one can be there for you 24/7 and if that's what you need then hospitalization is a good option. I've been there. \n\nAnd be there for your friends, too. Know your own limits and respect them as well, and still do what you can. Friend going through a rough time that you aren't in a place to talk about? Make them cookies instead. If nothing else, let them know you care. Even just a short text helps.\n\nWhen I moved back across state lines, some of my friends lent me money. Some provided emotional support. I know for sure I couldn't have done it without them.\n\nMy close friend spent several hours on the phone with me on the drive because I was relying on caffeine and grit to drive after staying up late packing, getting 6 hours of sleep, spending 11 hours packing and lifting in a July heatwave in Utah with a chronic pain disorder. This while another friend of hers was struggling.\n\nMy now-partner (we became official a few days later) then met me at the apartment we would be sharing with another friend of mine - who happened to need help with rent when I needed a place but we didn't know then if we'd be able to stay for more than a month. She helped with the heavy lifting that I couldn't do because the place I was supposed to stay had a dog that I had an allergic reaction to and I was up all night. She helped me take 80 percent of my stuff to the dump since I hadn't really had a chance to sort and push it out of the back of the truck. Then after she bought me food she stayed with me at the apartment until I fell asleep - she would be moving in the next day.\n\nI have tried my best since then to support her and the friends of mine I still have - whether they were able to help or not.", "I'm 13 and I read this whole thing through knowing full well I'm gonna forget it in half an hour", "I just moved into my own appartment at 17 since my parents kicked me out so this will be extremely helpful!

After today I will officially be 20 years old. To celebrate the milestone, here\u2019s 20 bits of advice I wish I had when I had just become a teenager (turning 13)", "1. Being a teenager is hard as fuck; you find yourself in a state of flux where almost nobody will relate at all to you, whether they\u2019re young or old. *This is okay.*\n\n2. It\u2019s gonna take a while for you to find who you really are. You probably won\u2019t start settling on a solid persona until you hit 16-18.\n\n3. What seems permanent right now is most likely just a phase, even though you said how much it really is you forever now.\n\n4. That doesn\u2019t mean resist what you want to do because it\u2019s just a phase. Embrace the weird stuff. Listen to death metal. Watch anime. Paint your nails. Wear crazy neon colors that don\u2019t match. Do it. And take lots of pictures when you do. It\u2019ll be hilarious later.\n\n5. Talk to your crush. Ask her out. It\u2019s okay to be nervous, just don\u2019t be weird.\n\n6. It helps if you get to know her as a person a little bit before making your move, and at least make it *seem* like you have a sense of self-respect. Clean up after yourself, look/smell clean, and for fuck\u2019s sake, don\u2019t seem like you\u2019re desperate.\n\n7. **Make some goddamn friends.** It absolutely sucks to look back on most of your high school experience and realize that all you did was play video games, watch anime, and jerk off the entire time. All that will do is make you feel depressed and worthless. (You\u2019re still gonna feel that way regardless, but at least you\u2019ll have someone to talk about it with)\n\n8. Find some people that you can relate to. If you\u2019re a nerd who likes to talk about anime, science, and video games, try talking to the quiet kid or something.\n\n9. Sit in the *back of every fucking class*. If you\u2019re lucky you can snack, use your phone, and draw dicks on the table all year without the teacher noticing.\n\n10. In a few years. you\u2019re either gonna find a lot of formerly cool shit right to be cringy as fuck, or you\u2019re going to *be* cringy as fuck. Try to be the first one.\n\n11. Learn to laugh at your cringeworthy moments, and learn from your true mistakes.\n\n12. Talk to the janitor. Learn his/her name. Use it.\n\n13. Talk to the security guards. Find out which ones are the cool ones. Trust me, I\u2019ve gotten out of *so much shit* just because I had a security guard cover my ass.\n\n14. Join clubs. If you don\u2019t like them, don\u2019t go, but at least try a few and see if you can get involved. Same goes with after-school activities.\n\n15. If you\u2019re gonna fuck, **get some fucking protection.**\n\n16. If you\u2019re gonna smoke weed, **get some fucking snacks, and do it with people that you like.**\n\n17. If you\u2019re not primarily focused on academics, getting a part-time job to earn some cash is literally one of the best things you can do while still in school.\n\n18. That doesn\u2019t mean \u201cget all \u2018C\u2019s and work at McDonalds\u201d. Your academics are important and your performance in school should be a priority.\n\n19. Getting a license and a car is **SO FUCKING WORTH IT.** Your world opens up like ten times over when you suddenly have the capability to drive anywhere you want to go. If you\u2019re the guy/girl with a ride, it\u2019s super easy to cement yourself as the \u201cpack leader\u201d for your friend group. Plus it\u2019s going to set you up for success after you graduate.\n\n20. More than anything, live life how you really want, on your terms. Don\u2019t bottle yourself up and hide who you really are. You\u2019re a special, one-of-a-kind human being and there won\u2019t ever be another person like you ever again. You are made up of the essence of a thousand dying stars, and you have that same power to light up the world with what potential you have.

You'll learn to value friendship a lot more and value the people that you knew when you were young. Adult life *is* fun, it's just a different kind of fun. A more solitary fun.\n\nAlso, don't throw away your memories. Once you leave for college you have no room for anything, and it's easy to throw everything out and start fresh. Don't do that.

I  remember back in February, I was talking to a couple of girls about some tough things that I was going through and at the end of the class they both hugged me and said that I could talk to them anytime. I still think about that day from time to time and they've become close friends of mine.\n\n\\- Don't be pressured to wear makeup all the time. Yeah, y'all look good with makeup, but if we're close then I could care less, especially if it's just the two of us.\n\n\\- If you know a guy likes you, don't be afraid to make the first move. We're always so worried about rejection and usually it's pretty clear that a guy's into you, but we suck at taking hints. It's okay to make the first move, and if you do, our confidence goes through the roof.\n\n\\- We don't need sex. Seriously, except for the few horndogs in here, we're totally good without it. It's overrated, I won't do it again until marriage or until I know I'm with The One.\n\n\\- The best way to flirt with us is to laugh at our jokes, show some physical affection, and show that you want to be with us. If you give that vibe that you like talking to me and hanging out with me, I can pick it up, and most guys can too.\n\n\\- Don't be afraid of being too clingy. The first relationship I was in, she was always worried about being clingy or too \"all-over-me.\" Tbh, I liked that she showed me attention and I never thought it was a problem, even after telling her it was okay.\n\n\\- Sometimes we're assholes but we don't mean to be. We just don't understand sometimes that our tone or words can come off differently than we intend, and we can have no clue what we did wrong. Be honest with us and good guys will work on it and learn.\n\n\\- Sometimes we need a friend more than a girlfriend. The best friends I've ever had were girls I tried to get with, then I get friend zoned, and we form a great friendship. Stuff like that is wholesome and I'm grateful for those rejections because I need them.\n\n\\- If you can figure out what the guy likes, show a little interest. For me it's a little different. I work at a summer camp, and I love working with kids. I head back to work tomorrow for the rest of the summer. Girls that work great with kids is sooo attractive to me, and a lot of other guys. But it can be sports, hobbies, shows, music, etc.\n\nConfidence is key, and if you show confidence, even if internally you aren't (trust me I'm self-conscious as hell), we'll notice and it's super attractive.  Hope y'all have a good Sunday evening!  \n\n\nEdit: Damn, thank y'all for all the love! I told y'all no awards lol. If anyone needs to just talk to someone, my DM's are open!

And from what I've seen, there's some pretty wild perspectives on life here. I come from a pretty wild place in life myself, and I've learned some very different things in the short time I've been a lawful adult. So here you go.\n\n1. To the teens starting to work or those who haven't had a job before, there's a difference between getting ragged on by people, and getting genuinely helpful advice. If a senior at your place of employment is constantly giving you corrections and telling you to do something specific, for the sake of routine, it's not because they think you're bad at your job. It's because they want you to succeed in your job and your life. If people stop giving you advice and making corrections on your work, it's most likely because you didn't listen or improve and they have written you off. It's harsh, but that's just how it is sometimes.\n\n2. Do NOT underestimate the power of being early or on time. Showing up to work ten minutes early is an extremely healthy example of good time management. Your employer already expects this of you, so seeing someone dedicated to this very important aspect of life is a good spot on your track record with them.\n\n3. No matter how easy it comes or how much you want to, do not ever spread gossip or rumors. If someone is blurting out private information of other people to you, you are well within your right to straight up ignore them. The older lady who won't stop bitching about the manager she doesn't like? Ignore her. It's very easy for rumors and gossip to go back on you.\n3(b). Bonus tip: The sooner you accept that no matter what you do or what you say, people will gossip about you your entire life. Most of the time it's harmless banter, but for real, the more you attach value or attention to what people say about you, the more it's going to eat at your mental health.\n\n4. Hygiene and cleanliness go a long way. Make it a priority at home to take extra care to properly clean yourself and take care of your teeth. If you think people won't notice if you miss a shower, I can 100% guarantee that they will. Your teeth aren't necessarily a key factor in your appearance as I don't think people care that much, but if you have to think about whether your breath smells? It does.\n\n5. I know that the opinion and view on this is very different with everyone and varies depending on the person, but you gotta toughen up a little emotionally if you're going to join the work force. If somebody makes one comment or twenty on your work or personality or appearance, nothing is more important than maintaining your composure and letting it go. Life is hard and sometimes you gotta chew a few nails. If someone is blatantly trying to aggravate you and elicit an angry or negative reaction from you? Do not hesitate to file a complaint. A lot of companies have some form of anonymous complaint hotlines, ask a co-worker you trust how to access these resources if available.\n\n6. People teasing you doesn't always mean they don't like you or want to hurt your feelings. There's a pretty good chance that if someone suddenly stops making fun or teasing you, that's when they stop liking you. Don't take stuff too hard if you don't know what they're intentions. Better yet, ask them. If they're not upset or annoyed by you, they will give you a serious and honest answer.\n\n7. Don't pry into personal details regardless of how good your working relationship seems to be. It is extremely unprofessional to prod for juicy personal stuff because it's pretty much guaranteed that it will somehow get out and may put their employment on the line (just a more extreme example).\n\n8. Once you're clocked in, it is obligation and dedication until you're off the clock. You're there to earn money and make a living, but so are the people who hired you and those who are working alongside you. Respect everyone's time as you would wish yours to be, because the only obligation to you is that which follows you doing your job: a paycheck.\n\n9. I'm sure that many of you are sick of hearing this, I was too at one point, but sometimes you gotta suck it up and stick it out. If you quit one job, there's no guarantee that the next one makes you look back on the previous one as \"not that bad\" all of a sudden.\n\n\nThank you for reading everyone, my father (63) and I (19, for now) made this list together specifically for this sub. We both hope that you all stay safe and take care of yourselves, and we also pray that life provides you with many opportunities to learn and grow with dignity and shared respect.\n\nEdit: Wow, this is the most that any of my posts have blown up.

Take the time to portion paychecks diligently and really think about what you\u2019re putting your money towards. A lot of friends of mine throw away their hard earned cash on fast food, and fun expensive toys they probably dont need. Theres a 4 step process I follow when it comes to saving. The first is to find how much money you need to buy whatever it is you want(I\u2019ll use a car as an example since its the first thing pretty much everyone saves for). The second is to figure out how much you\u2019ll be making each week at your job on average(restaurant jobs with tips can make this number skyrocket if the managers arent greedy). The third step is finding out how much you spend in a week. From these three numbers you find out how long it will take to save for a car and you can adjust all three numbers to a get the length of time to something you like.\n\nYou can either decide to spend less money on a car, cut back on weekly expenses, ask for more hours at work, or decide to save for a longer period of time. For me at least this strategy has helped me a lot in saving for a car. I basically became disgusted with the amount of money I would spend at dunkin donuts every week(since it added up to about $1000 a year when getting a drink and breakfast sandwich before work) and ended up getting more hours at work and saving for an extra year.\n\nThe other thing is that the more money you spend on a car, the less used and broken down it becomes. This usually equates to less surprise expenses from parts needing to be replaced or the whole thing just breaking down, better gas mileage, and all around having a nicer car that lasts longer.\n\nTLDR: every $20 dollars you spend each week on fast food or games adds up to $1000 a year despite it not seeming like that much until you do the math.", "This is all very true and real.

It started with small things like pens, couple dollars and then a couple days ago, a condom i had lying in my drawer. Apparently, my brother took this condom i had and beat off into it while my family and i where out of the house. When we came back we heard him scrambling and quickly running into his room. Later that day my mom was shouting at my dad very loudly and calling him unfaithful. My mom found a used condom stuffed in between the couch cushions. My mom basically thinks my dad is having an affair. I was super confused and then my brother fessed up to me, but he doesn't have the courage to tell my mom. I felt like stopping this situation right in its tracks but for some reason my father is not denying the claims. So i think my brother just lit the match on my parents marriage. I am starting to believe my dad really might have had a broad over because this is not passed his character. I told my brother if guilt eats at him he can fess up, but im out of the house in a couple months anyways, and i know my mom had suspicion of my dad previously. My dad is probably like \"fuck, i knew i got rid of that thing\"...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit- if people are wondering why i wasn't the one questioned about the condom its because I've been settling into an apartment. i just turned 18 in March.\n\nEdit 2- if people want me to update i can tonight when i visit for dinner. Set a timer for 7pm EST. BROUGHT TO YOU BY RAID: SHADOW LEGENDS!\n\nUpdate: Talked to my mom about it, apparently they are still a little sour at each other, but i doubt my parents will split because of THIS SITUATION exactly. My mom is grossed out and especially with the health concerns going on right now. My brother is pretty embarrassed and took his dinner to his room. My father basically said he didn't deny my moms accusations because hes not a lair or adulterer.

A lot of horny teenage dudes lose their sex drive by 30, and you can't metabolize liquor anymore - I had to give it up years ago. \"\n* Going to university is expensive but straightforward. Going to community college and transferring is a nightmare. I'm going through it the *second* time, and while I'm saving a lot of money and actually graduating faster for it, it's required me being total asshole to everyone I've encountered. And it turned out that the very friendly people at the university were fucking me over once again - being a demanding and rude doesn't make me friends, but it's saved me *$20,000 and counting.*\n* Debt is bad, and the people who should be telling you the magnitude of the problem are rewarded for not doing so. OP feels pretty dumb for his decisions, but I know multiple people who dropped out of school with $50,000+ in debt who deeply wish they'd just spent the last few years getting high instead. And then there's the ones who graduated but can't work in the field.\n* Go find people and ask them questions even if they're not paid to answer them. I swerved a horrible career by sneaking into a career fair ad  annoying people until someone told me about their job. Rude, but the answer was *nothing* like how anyone ha described it.\n* Trades are a legitimate alternative to going to school, but they have a lot of disadvantages. Receiving advice from someone who hasn't been doing the job for 20+ years is going to be inaccurate at best. A lot of jobs cap their income depressingly low, and most of your pay is dependent on on working insane overtime at as much as *double* you base pay - but when you're too old to 80 hours a week, those triple-pay weeks aren't possible anymore, and your $30 an hour doesn't look so good with the looming dead seasons and economic slowdowns. And that's just *one* of the skilled trades.\n* Learning to fix bicycles is a great idea. Don't take it as a job.", "I'm 21 and have also made the same mistakes as OP. Senior year hit me hard.

Being a teenager senior citizen, I just wanted to use my elderly experience to help out some of you youngsters before yelling at you to get off my lawn. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not an expert and a lot of this advice might not be shit, however this is what I have personally learned from my experience as a teenager. If you have any other additional advice please comment it and I might add it to the list.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Go out and do stuff**. I currently work with kids ages 11-15 and I see so many being forced to go out and be social by their parents and hating it. I know it might push you out of your comfort zone, but go out there and have fun. Its hard at first but looking back on it now I wish I had done more. A lot of your loneliness and depression struggles will be solved just by doing this.\n* **Don't feel like you HAVE to be in a relationship.** 2 of my 3 relationships ended horribly and the 3rd one (1st one chronologically) was so meaningless that we never technically broke up; we just kinda stopped talking to each other...Now that I think about it we technically are still dating so I should probably get her a 7 year anniversary present. The majority of my great memories happened when I was with my friends (boys and girls) rather than with a partner. I know it might feel like you have to get a girlfriend or boyfriend but unless you really like someone, its not always worth it.\n* **That being said, if you do like someone just go for it.** Yeah, there's a good 50% chance that you'll get rejected but chances are no ones going to care about it later. Just go up to him/her and go for it. Obviously you'll need some build up by flirting, but don't be afraid.  One thing that I've noticed is that chances are if you are feeling things about someone, he/she is feeling the same way about you.\n* **Sometimes the best way to get someone to like you is to simply tell them.** Ive had this happen both ways for me. Ive had girls that I've never thought about tell me that they like me thus resulting with me liking them and Ive also had it happen where I've subtly told girls that I like them which resulted with them liking me back. Its an odd phenomenon but it does happen. Maybe don't go in their face and go \"HEY GIRL I HAVE A HUGE CRUSH ON YOU\" but just tell them that they're cute or something small (just dont be creepy about it and work it into the conversation).\n* **When you apply to college do not slack off.** I fucked up real bad and didn't prepare myself very well and did a lot of things last minute. This ended with me getting rejected from some serious schools that my grades were competitive in.\n* **1 grade does matter.** This one daily goes out to those trying to get into difficult colleges. A lot of people will tell you that \"oh, just one D won't hurt you\", but let me tell you, it will. This usually only matters if it is in the subject are that you are planning on studying in though. I had a C+ during my first semester of precalculus, and despite getting an A during second semester and an A during both semesters Calculus a few schools that rejected told me that it was because of that one C+. I know a lot of you aren't going for super prestigious schools, but for the handful that are PLEEEEEEAAAASSEEE take your grades seriously.\n* **Get a job that you love.** I HATED my parents when they forced me to get a job during my summer after my freshman year. I ended up getting a job at a grocery store as a bagger. I worked there for literally a grand total of 4 days before quitting. After that I got a job somewhere else (Not going to say exactly where because I don't want to be identified) and I ended up loving it. Literally had some of the best memories of my life there and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Yeah, I could have made more money working as a waiter but it didn't even feel like I was working where I worked.\n* **Get social media!!** (instagram, facebook, snapchat...). I used to be like a lot of you guys. I hated social media and I didn't want anything to do with it. I never even set up an instagram or facebook account until my senior year. The reason why I say this is because even though Ive only just graduated, I am already quickly losing contact with a lot of friends. I wish I started my social media accounts sooner to make it less awkward to connect with them later on.\n* **Adulthood hits you like a truck so enjoy being a child.** It's so weird because it legitimately just feels like one day your suddenly an adult and you no longer have the protections of a child. Everyone kinda has this \"oh shit\" moment when they realize it. For me it was when I was going to a friends school to bring them something. I forgot to check in with the office and the secretary chased me down yelling \"Sir, you need to check in at the office\". It was the first time that I was ever addressed as Sir and not as a child.\n* **Drugs and alcohol are fun, but they are not worth it.** During spring break you do not want to be the kid who has to call their friends parents to tell them that he has passed away because he OD on drugs. It is horrible and it is impossible to get over. Just do not do it. Even the things that seem harmless aren't worth it because it never stops there.\n* **Connect with your teachers.** They are resources that you can use both in school and years later. I had a teacher write me a letter of recommendation that literally almost made me cry it was so good. I haven't started my first year of college yet, but I also been told by friends the they constantly email their old teachers asking them for help. Your teachers are not just there for you during the school year, but they are there for you for your life. If you have a question just ask them.\n* **Join a team.** It doesn't have to be a sports team. Joining a team will help build skills that will be useful for your entire life. I also made my best friends this way.\n* **Just because other people are doing it doesn't make it right.** This is something that has fucked me sooooooo many times. I am a pretty innocent person which has led me to be taken advantage of many many times. If someone, even your best friend, tells you to do something think about the consequences prior to doing it. Im not going to go into details about this, but my life was almost ruined because someone peer pressured me into doing something.\n* **Adults are (usually) not out to get you.** They (usually) just want what is best for you. During my junior year we had something happen at our school that a lot of people thought that the staff mishandled. We had students complaining about it for weeks afterwards and putting blame on the staff and criticizing them for not doing their job right. Sometimes this is hard to understand, especially as a teenager when you want to be an adult so badly, but 90% of the time those who are in charge of you just wants what is best for you. In the case that I am referring too, the situation was extremely bizarre and the staff didn't want to cause panic. They did what they did not because they wanted to withhold information from us but because they wanted to protect us.\n* **Look at things from the other persons perspective.** This goes off of the last one. Before getting mad because someone did something that hurt you just try to understand the reasons as to why they did that. I know that this is hard sometimes, but it will help you as a person. As I have said before, 90% of the time people are not out to get you and its usually just a misunderstanding.\n* **Start a resume early.** This is pretty self explanatory, but its easy to write about an event when it initially happens. Maybe dont even start a resume but just start portfolio that documents events in your life.\n* **TAKE PICTURES.** I fucking HATED people taking pictures of me so much that there are almost no pictures of me from the last 4 years. In the future you are going to want to look back at events and have good memories. Even if it hurts you now, having pictures of events will bring you joy in the future.\n* **Being cool is not worth missing out.** This is something that I have always struggled with. I always wanted to be the cool kid. Fuck whatever is popular and fuck adults amiright? Wrong. Do what you want to do (within legal bounds) without worrying about how it will affect your social status.\n* **Take care of your body,** you'll appreciate it later. Specifically your back (proper lifting). Before eating that giant greasy hamburger think if its really worth it. If its what you've been craving all day then go ahead and eat it, but if you're okay with passing and taking a salad instead then don't go for it.\n* **Play an instrument**. There is nothing more beautiful in this world than music. When I say play an instrument I dont mean play an instrument in concert band or orchestra, I mean actually play music the you love on your own time. It helps you express creativity and helps with your emotions. Even if its just strumming a few chords on the guitar it is still worth it.\n* **Always have extra cash on you.** It rarely happens, but theres going to be one time where you are forced to use cash and you won't have it.\n* **Tell people how much you appreciate them**. To this day this is something that I struggle with. I know that its sometimes hard or awkward, but one day you're going to lose someone out of nowhere and you will regret it if you never tell them how much you appreciate them.\n* **Don't go out with someone just because you want to have sex with them.** I know a lot of you guys want to lose it ASAP, but its not worth it if its not with someone that you truly love.\n* **Don't feel obligated to have sex with someone:** This goes off of the last one. If you aren't ready you aren't ready. It's your body. If you don't want to do it don't do it.\n* **Do an all nighter at least once.** Im sure 90% of you have already done this but you reach a form of enlightenment at 4 am when you and your friends are high af (Hey, sometimes I don't listen to my own rules) and sleep deprived.\n* **Do not text and drive.** I saw a car flip once because the person was texting while driving I, a 17 year old at the time, was the person that pulled the injured and bloody person out of the car. I have no idea how he didn't die. I also got hit once from behind by someone texting while driving and that was not fun so for the sake of everyone else, turn your phone off if you can't keep away from it.\n* **Don't just like something because its popular**: Go be your own person. Whether its music, a video game, a sport, or whatever the hell your into, sometimes the most popular options aren't what is for you. Go and explore a little before settling on what is popular.\n* **Choose your friends wisely:**  I know that it's hard to cut off a life long friend, but sometimes the person's toxicity is not worth it. I had to do it with someone that I was friends with since I was 5 a few years ago, and you know where he is now? prison. Sometimes it's just not worth sticking with someone.\n* **Learn self control:** Sometimes you just feel  like you just want to punch a wall because you're so mad (ive done it and broken a bone because of it), or you just want to lose your mind and get lit af, or maybe you just want to go spend your life savings on a new guitar because it looks cool. Sometimes this stuff is okay, sometimes it's not. Just learn to control yourself before you ruin yourself. Ive done all of the above and regretted doing all of the above.\n* **Do not hesitate to ask for help:** To this day I still struggle to ask for help and I know that I am hypocritical saying this. Use your resources to help you out. A lot of times it might feel like you're abandoned on an island but there are people out there for you. Whether it is a teacher for educational help, a counselor for emotional help, or a friend for social help there is always someone willing to help you out.\n* **If you are feeling sick go to the doctor:** I know someone who had a cough for 9 months and refused to go to the doctor because it was just a nuisance and nothing major. Turns out she had cancer in her throat. I know it may feel stupid going to the doctor for some things, but it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nEdit: this blew up out of nowhere.

One piece of advice, if someone tries harassing you on social media, or types some mean stuff about you, send them this little blurb. \"Think before you act, your actions have consequences. There is no rewind button in life\" if the person knows better, it should end there. If they continue, get a parent involved. I know it sounds bad to not go to a teacher as well, but in my experience, the teachers dont want to deal with it and will try to brush it off if it isnt severe enough. A decent parent will fight like a mad bulldog, and you can rely on a parent who has been with you for your whole life.

Even if others have done more than you, they go out drinking, they have done drugs, go to parties or have had multiple girlfriends or boyfriends, don\u2019t let that put yourself down. Everyone gets different opportunities at different times, and some might not get any at all. What\u2019s important is that when you do get an opportunity to do something you want to do, something that you think you will enjoy or will help you grow as a person, take it. And if you don\u2019t get any opportunities, make \u2018em! Ask that friend if you can join them on that party, ask someone out, call your friends in the middle of the night and sneak out and go for a walk listening to rad music or call that friend you haven\u2019t talked to in forever and ask them if they wanna catch up!

It takes patience, talk to them everyday, and don't let the conversation die down (But don't push it too much, it can lead to failure, requested by u/NorthStar6-4 ) , let it be talking in IRL, on call or in texts.\n2. Complement them. But only say honest things: for example \"You look great today\" if she took extra effort to get ready that day, or \"Your hair is really nice and soft\" if you can see that she takes care of her hair. Also compliment not only her physical traits but also her personality, for example: \"You are very smart, hardworking, kind\" (Personality contribution by u/WonszykReczny\n3. Be funny. I understand this may not be easy for some idiots on here that just say \"haha get rick rolled noob funny poopy\",  but try to make smart jokes. Look on r/cardsagainsthumanity for some real funny shit. But make the jokes at the right time, like if her grandmother died, don't say: \"Well, you have another one\".\n4. Listen to them. Really listen to what they have to say, pay attention to what they tell you. And reply to it with your real opinion, you want them to like you for who you are, not for some fake personality.\n5. Talk to them about personal things. If you have any family problems, (Ok I can't think of anything personal but just pretend I did)\n6. Don't rush it. Take your time, it won't just happen 2 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes and 21 seconds after you start talking to her. I was talking to this girl for months on end, and it looked like nothing was going to happen\n7. Give physical and emotional support. If they are sad, hug them and try to help their problem, they will really appreciate it!\n8. Treat them like a human being, don't treat them like a goddess, they are not.  (By u/ i lost the person pls send me a message)\n9. If they aren't meeting you half way save yourself the emotional embarrassment and leave them. Obviously at first it'll be one sided but if it doesn't quickly turn into equal care it's not worth it.  (By u/ i lost the person pls send me a message)\n10. Love yourself before you love a partner, getting in a relationship when you can't even bare your own personality *WILL* lead to a trainwreck. (By u/ i lost the person pls send me a message)\n\nTLDR: Read the whole post you lazy bugger\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk thank you for coming to my TED Talk, now you have what it takes to get a girlfriend.

I wanted to pour my heart out to you all and give some advice that I have learned. I hope this helps you", "First of all thank you all for all that you have done. You have provided me with countless entertainment and a feeling of belonging on this site. Yes, sometimes I can be annoyed with the things that come out of this sub but overall I am happy and proud of you all. \n\nBefore I forever transition out of being a teenager I wanted to leave you all with some advice that I have learned as I have gone through life. (I apologize for any typos. Typing as an American all of these things might not apply) I do not have the handbook for life, not everything will apply 100% to you or those around you.  My life isn\u2019t yours. It I have watched and learned from people and life and found that these things may help\n\n**Intentionally cultivate your interests** . As you try to navigate life the only thing you truly have is yourself. If you spend your time doing things arbitrarily, when rubber meets the road you will be left behind, and it will not feel good, and you will know it. This will help you become valuable to the world in terms of jobs, friendships, intrinsic confidence, dating, and long term joy.  Well trained and cared for animals and being able to cook good food make you appealing in the dating world and keep life interesting. If you can, learn a language and try out music. I promise life with those two things is so much more fulfilling. Work hard, work with a goal in mind, work intelligently and work well. Know you value, you are a person, not a capitalist number. You work to live, not vice versa. Don\u2019t worry about being a part of the latest trend of popular things. Be yourself because only you have to live life being you.\n\n**Emotions** - as a teenager your emotions and logic are bound to be like a frantic squirrel bouncing around a cage. This makes it difficult for anyone to instill any sort of logic/ discipline into you, especially if you are a younger teenager. Listen carefully even when you feel you are being wronged or like no one understands you. It could be the difference between you having to learn the hurtful way, and succeeding. Do not quarrel unnecessarily. Do not be easily offended. Learn to not take things personally and understand you are not the most important person in the world. Understand that people believe in different things and this doesn\u2019t make them bad, even if they offend you. It makes the world what it is, dynamic, and diverse. Learn to objectively view your emotions, and write them down. It will help you analyze them and push forward in life. It it won\u2019t matter in a year or so don\u2019t fret over it. Be confident in yourself. If you have confident issues act like you own the place. Never let your emotions make you act in ways that can be deemed foolish. Never take your own life. No matter how upset you are. Emotions are fluid and they will pass. Grief is aweful but it does get better. So are hard and good times. Never let \u201clove\u201d make you do stupid things. I write this as an incredibly stressed and somewhat depressed young man. My mind is enveloped in my feelings and I feel like it won\u2019t end. It will, and life will become joyful again. Something I live by is \u201cif you feel like your going through hell act like you own the place\u201d. It is best to stay away from all substances regardless of how \u201cnatural\u201d they are. I have learned that every single person I have watched used any sort of substances, especially to help regulate emotions/or remove them from the pain of reality has either died, or destroyed their life by themselves or with others. \n\n**Respect**- give everyone the respect they don\u2019t deserve. Reddit doesnt give me enough room to express how much this has not only saved my butt from bad situations, but elevated me above my peers even when I don\u2019t deserve it. From that insignificant person at the gas station to the principal of your school, give them the same respect you would if your life was in their hands. From potential legal trouble, to getting recommended by the teachers I despised, my dedication to loving my neighbor has helped me win more than I should have. Do not let anyone walk over you. Remove yourself from bad situations respectfully, always know your worth, always keep your cool and make sure you are not taken advantage of. Stand up for those who need help. Do not gossip, speak well of others and avoid those who don\u2019t. Respect everyone regardless of their beliefs, life choices, physical or mental attributes, sexuality, religion, nationality, origin, political leaning etc even if they make you uncomfortable. The actions of most people disagree, however I can attest that people have an amazing ability to rally around and help those who are different than them, if they they feel that person makes an effort to be good to them. Reputation is everything, you come into this world with nothing, and leave with only that. Listen more than you speak\n\n**You live by cancel culture you WILL die by cancel culture** No one lives to escape its devious grasps. Give grace to those even if you don\u2019t think they deserve it. We all have our skeletons in the closet\n\n**Fighting** - avoid fights at all costs. Unless you are backed into a corner and your safety is on the line avoid them. Remember this one saying, \u201cmost people don\u2019t want to fight you, they want to hit you\u201d- Joe Rogan. Choose your battles and carefully and keep this in mind. Being considered a wimp as a teenager matters as much as a fart in a field. Fights are dangerous and leave people maimed and dead regularly. People don\u2019t care these days and they like to see others hurt. They are not worth the legal trouble or loss of reputation. If you must fight to avoid bullying make sure it is 10000% unavoidable and worth it. I personally have fought bullies and almost been arrested. My bullies stopped and I avoided legal trouble bc my administration knew me as highly respectful. Unfortunately, you are not in your parents' time. The poor choices you make now will be seared into society\u2019s memories and follow you for eternity. If you must fight, fight justly, with unavoidable reason and with confidence. Swing with a closed fist, thumb closed up and resting underneath your palm(NOT STICKING OUT), using the bottom of your palm/wrist to strike will also work, protect your chin, DO NOT FIGHT ON HARD SURFACES, ladies ball up your hair. Don\u2019t go to the ground unless you know how. Your punches will feel like jelly but that is your adrenaline helping you not feel as much pain. Jiu jitsu and Muay Thai kick boxing are often revered as the most practical and most worth your money for training. I can attest to this as well.\n\n(If you live in an environment that forces you to fight often, you know better than I do, and my best advice is to fight with good fundamentals. Use discernment and avoid bad situations.) \n\n**Discipline**- discipline is the difference between those who succeed vs those who fail in life. Master your urges so that you do not need to itch them. Including and especially sexual urges even if it is difficult. They will take you further than you wanna go and can lead to many bad things in life including wasted time and medical problems. Rid yourself of your vices. Do not be reckless, have fun, live is too short to be reserved by calculate your choices. Despite what people might say, do not chase sex with droves of people even in your young years, enjoy it with the one person who matter most. Those who are guided by sex, I have typically watched, ruin their lives legally, socially, and they begin to sexualization everything. It makes them repulsive to everyone, even if those around them don\u2019t mention it. Life is way better when you aren\u2019t looking at everything and everyone through horny eyes. Wake up at a reasonable time and get life started, even if its reading or working out. Eat well and exercise to the best of your abilities, this will pay off later. Stop making excuses, make a change. Schedule your life in a writing and budget. Living arbitrarily leads to forgetfulness, failure and mistakes. Your death and the life remembered will likely be a 100% reflection of your life. Your habits almost always control your destiny and your death.\n\n**Quality over quantity**- this applies to everything in life. This is most included in friendships. Do not chase the \u201cpopular kid\u201d life. They typically flop after highschool or college. Find a few good friends in life who aim to help you succeed. Do not align yourself with fringe online ideologies. If you need help with dating, or life in general , find a wise older person/mentor in your life to give you quality wisdom, not a comment section filled with tons of ideas unspecific to your life and reality. Cultivate your relationships. People are here for a season. Nothing is permanent. Tell your people you love them and always keep them in your heart. When the world rejects you or the heat turns up, all you have are close family and friends. Quality over quantity.\n\n**Your future** I live in a western world where college is pushed on young people. I do not know what it is like for those not in a western nation so I apologize if this is unrelatable. Do not allow yourself to be force fed into the school to college machine, unless you are more than certain it is for you. Overall, when planning your future it can be scary. It can be hard to try and do risk assessment. It is for this reason that it is crucial to have the wisdom of those whose lives speak with actions. They can help you, no one can do it alone, not even you. If it helps, when making decisions try to think long term. See which option has the best long term results, and then research how badly it would affect your life if that option failed. Weigh them. Use the wise opinions of others with lives that prove their value. The world and their opinion is constantly changing. It is best to have a stable moral compass that can survive the fluidity of the world\u2019s right and wrong. Many people find religion to be helpful in this manner. Me personally a Christ follower. But to each his own\n\nAlso, it helps learn how to be handy and fix things. Learn how they work so repairmen can\u2019t scam you\n\n**Edit: I think I\u2019ll add my two cents on dating after some requests**\nThis all depends on culture, place of origin, sexuality and desires but I have found this relatively true. I am a straight male in a western world so and this is what I have learned. Nothing comes from a place of hurt or intention to offend\n\n**Assuming you are a straight guy** I\u2019d advise you to see what attracts women. Women are the queens of what women want. However what they often say may be slightly different from what their beliefs in practice say. Take this with a grain of salt. Make friends with women and it will help you learn from them. They, like anyone can be ridiculous at times so being around them will help you get first hand experience. Regardless of what the \u201cI\u2019m so woke and kind and I love everyone and everything is love\u201d fake people tell you, the vast majority of women have strong preferences. Although all are not the same the vast majority like relatively in shape men who can provide and protect to some extent along with making her feel loved and appreciated. Low self esteem gets you nowhere with them. **THEY ARE PEOPLE NOT OBJECTS. They are daughters and mothers etc. Do not use them for sex or gratification. They will know and never trust you if you do this. A big fuck you to those who use women for their own pleasure** Douchebags tend to use \u201calpha a beta\u201d when describing men. Women tend to be more sensitive than men so keep this in mind. (Look up spaghetti girls, waffle guys. It may give you some insight) Some combo of all this. Build yourself up in these areas. so remember don\u2019t focus your life around getting laid or else it may come back to bite you in the butt, badly. My personal preference is to wait until marriage. If that\u2019s not for you I won\u2019t force it on you but I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s best to keep your body count as low as possible, even women don\u2019t like man hoes. In practice even the most modern and feminist women like traditionalist men who ask women out and pay for dates. Avoid the virtue signaling new age stuff and stick to what is tried and true. As Kanye West once said, \u201cone good girl is worth a thousand bitches\u201d, that is absolute facts. **DO NOT ATTACH YOURSELF TO FRINGE DATING IDEOLOGIES LIKE MGTOW, INCEL, ETC**. Bad people exist just like good people. Yes I will generalize and tell you that it will make you despise women and see them as a scourge on the Earth, they are not your enemy, they are your friends and partners. If you dislike or generalize the other sex, you have failed, miserably at life itself. **Use a mentor to help you navigate. I\u2019m barely older than you and a older women or man\u2019s advice may better suit you!** \n\n**For my straight western ladies**\nMen typically like fit and friendly women who are happy. We do not care if you have a PHD or a college. We want a good companion who will help us along in life. We are simple and don\u2019t think as complicated as you all. The world is tough on us and being able to have a loving companion who lets us be vulnerable secretly means the world to us. Do not let the rampant porn culture than is plaguing men make you insecure about your bodies. Find a man who is invested in you, not women on a screen. Never settle but don\u2019t have unrealistic expectations and standards. No one is intimated by a strong woman or man for that matter. If you say this you have already failed. It is likely your disposition. Same goes for men. Sometimes men get uncomfortable rejecting you and it comes off as fearful. Men are the Kings of what men want, NOT WOMEN. Many western women think it\u2019s their place to convince men to like what they believe they should like. Investing your energy in building yourself according to reality, not Twitter belief systems, this is how you move to the front of the line. Genuine apologies mean the world to us as many of us are taught to take BS from women without resisting. We won\u2019t be vulnerable around you unless we trust you. If you go behind our backs with our deep feelings we will never forget, even if we forgive.  The best way to know what men want is to be around men and learn from them. Securing women\u2019s rights is your right as a human, however, I feel confident in generalizing to say avoid or be cautious around any 3rd and later wave of feminism. Many parts of it will convince you to despise men. Men are your partners in life, not enemies. Bad people are bad, good are good. If you despise or generalize one gender if people you have failed miserably at life. An older wise mentor will give better more specific vice than I can. Message me if you need anything else.

Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited.\nPillage is prohibited.\nReprisals against protected persons and their property is prohibited.\"\nUnder the 1949 Geneva Conventions, collective punishment is a war crime. By collective punishment, the drafters of the Geneva Conventions had in mind the reprisal killings of World War I and World War II. In the First World War, the Germans executed Belgian villagers in mass retribution for resistance activity during the Rape of Belgium. In World War II, both the Germans and the Japanese carried out a form of collective punishment to suppress resistance. Entire villages or towns or districts were held responsible for any resistance activity that occurred at those places.[5] The conventions, to counter this, reiterated the principle of individual responsibility. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Commentary to the conventions states that parties to a conflict often would resort to \"intimidatory measures to terrorize the population\" in hopes of preventing hostile acts, but such practices \"strike at guilty and innocent alike. They are opposed to all principles based on humanity and justice.\"\n\nAdditional Protocol II of 1977 explicitly forbids collective punishment.

I hope you will follow them, or at least learn from them, thats all I want, you all deserve to be happy\n\n1 - Listen to your parents, I know it sounds stupid, but in most cases they will be right - but don't forget you must listen to yourself also, take your parents' advice, they are there to help you in life\n\n2 - If you feel a friend has bad influence on you - just let them go, memories last, sometimes forever, but being in a toxic company is way worse, I've been forced to do things mainly because others in my company were thinking it's ''cool''\n\n3 - Take relationships seriously, since I am a guy, I can talk about guys, don't break girls' hearts, be good, if you get hurt, don't become ''that guy'', you know what I talk about, remember the nice things and move on\n\n4 - Music will be your friend, don't ever be ashamed to listen to music you enjoy just because others hate on it\n\n5 - Live life to it's fullest, time flies, I remember the times when me and my friends were playing Minecraft all night long, sleeping late for school because of that our friend died in the cave and we had to find his items\n\n6 - If you believe you got some kind of mental illness, talk to your parents, if they do not take you seriously in first place, take your time to make the conversation serious, your mental health is a priority!!\n\n7 - Don't compare to others, you are unique\n\n8 - This is a really important one - DON'T DO DRUGS, especially hard ones (since a lot of people asked me about drugs in the comments - if you wanna try, be responsible and take care! Remove any sharp objects nearby, choose a nice company, enjoy the moment, don't overdo it - it wont end up in anything good, take care everyone!)\n\n9 - Sadly, the chances of you still being friends with the people you are friends with now - are very low, I am in contact with about 5-6, 1 or 2 of which I can trust my life\n\n10 - Stop obsessing with what you look on the outside, yea, I know, we all got that facial feature we hate, most people do not even notice\n\n11 - If a friend of yours seems sad or depressed, talk to them, sometimes a few nice words can save a life!!\n\n12 - USE CONDOMS!! Not only about pregnancy, there are tons of others who got STDs, keep yourself save\n\n13 - Just don't smoke, it's not cool, you smell like ashtray - save up those money and learn investing\n\n14 - Workout, fitness is great, it builds not only muscles, also your character and discipline\n\n15 - Be responsible, you must realize that words/actions may affect someone's life heavily - also yours\n\n16 - Play Minecraft from time to time, especially if you can invite friends in the server, this will build your friendship!\n\n17 - My favorite number, also fav year, when I was 17 my life literally changed''360 degrees no scope''  (this means it whooped me and made me rethink the way I live) - thats for those who do not understand why I used it that way- You need to understand that, life won't always be easy and happy, there will be days you will cry to be over, keep pushing, never give up!\n\n18 - Be responsible when driving, at 18 most of you will get their driving license, don't speed.. take your time to learn, practice is a must\n\nand last one\n\n19 - School is not teaching you the things you must know in life, to some point makes you stupid, I said it, same for university, it also kills artists and people with real talent, studying is important, but improving your skills outside of school is absolutely a must!If you ask a tiger and a fish to climb a tree, the fish will live it's life thinking it's worthless and stupid!! Same on the other side if you ask a tiger to swim in the deep ocean, find what you are good at, get better at it and rock life, also try to make some cash on the way to the top!\n\n\\--- Learn how to pay taxes ---\n\nI hope this helps, your fellow soon not to be a teenager friend - S\n\ncya guys when I turn 113, take care until then\n\nEdit: since its 2:38am for me now, I enjoyed reading and replying to each one of you, I will continue replying tommorow moment to as much as you, also my PM is open, I already helped a few in there, talk to you all tommorow, cya!\nEdit 2: Ayo, I gave my best to reply to as much comments as possible, but its actually impossible because of the huge flow, I am sorry for not replying to yall, take care guys, I will reply from time to time, but I am now busy since the week started for me, stay safe!\n\nEdit #420 - Since some of you wanted to send me Dogecoins for reaching out and helping yall (thank you guys, you helped me to buy a car lol) I've put my wallet in the description of my profile, have a great day", ["Hi!

While learning, I was constantly switching between an old jeep that I would later fix up and use, and my moms car. They were very different, and it is surprisingly easy to forget that one car will behave differently in situations then others. \n\nAlso, learn to service it properly. If you dont, bad things can happen. For instance, I replaced the brakes on mine. When I took off the pad, the caliper disintegrated in my hand. Fortunately they were cheap for my model, but it was scary knowing that this car has been driving like that for who knows how long, and how many cars on the road are still driving that are falling apart. \n\nLearn to service your vehicle yourself, it can save you tons of money in the long run. \n\nBuckle up, make sure your passengers are, as (at least where I live) the driver will be at fault it they arent.\n\nThank you OP, I will keep all these things in mind.", "Only 2 of these apply to me, but thanks", "My advise: build a health relationship with social media..I wasted a lot of time of my teenage years on social media ..social media is an amazing tool but it's easy to become addicted...

Psychological problems and mental disorders can lead to problematic porn use as a means to cope and self-medicate\" [1]\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association does not consider \"porn addiction\" a legitimate diagnosis or phenomenon, and has not included it in the DSM-V, because there is no scientific evidence that it exists. [2]\n\nIn an article in Socioaffective Neuroscience of Psychology, researchers tested [the] hypothesis that watching porn was \"like the effects of cocaine\" by studying the brains of people being shown pornographic images. The results showed no correlation between the porn and any kind of drug addiction, drug-like response, or addictive neurological response. [3]\n\nDr. David J. Ley, Ph.D., shows that it is not pornography itself that has addictive or problematic effects, but rather, negative opinions and views towards porn that positively correlate with porn-related problems. In the studies presented, those who viewed porn but were not raised to view sex and porn in a negative light had no more porn-related issues than those who did not view porn. [4]\n \nFinally, you can engage in healthy expressions of sexuality without relying on porn, if that is what suits you best. Movements like nofap have actually been shown to have damaging effects, and what little benefit they have is gravely drowned out.

The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure.

Don\u2019t know what made me do it, but I thought it would be a good idea to open it up and stick the pencil lead down my pee pee hole. It went in quite easily and I was about to take it out thinking it was a bad idea, but I couldn\u2019t actually pick up the lead. It was a good 3-4 millimetres down and I was starting to panic. I immediately went to a drawer under the sink and got out a pair of tweezers and began trying to pull it out.\n\nIt was at this point that it started to sting. Oh it stung like fire, relentless waves and waves of throbbing pain struck me as I, on the verge of tears kept trying to get it out. I only pushed it further in with the tweezers. The pain grew more and I was really panicking now. It felt as if there was acid inside. I turned on the sink and tried washing it out but to no avail. At this point I was ready to just have a breakdown.\n\nStanding there, drenched in water, my manly part on fire as I bit my knee, trying to get a hold of myself. The pain was so bad that I just wanted to cut it all off. I looked around again and saw that there was nothing else that could help me, and I did the only thing I knew how to do.\n\nI sat there, and took the single most painful fap I had ever taken in my entire life. When I finally went off, the pencil lead, now broken in 3 and covered with what looked like blood came out with the cum. It looked terrible but almost immediately the pain stopped and I just sat there, a failed man, covered in my own cum and blood, and cried silently for about 5 minutes.\n\nLesson learned: NEVER stick pencil lead down your pee pee hole.  \n\n\nEDIT:\nHere\u2019s an update on what\u2019s been going on.\nI took a piss and it slightly burned, a bit of blood came out as well. Think I may have cut something.  \nDo not stick pencil lead down your urethra, I have received comments from nurses saying it is safer to use something called a \u201csounding rod\u201d (I have no idea what this is and have no intention of looking it up).

In fact, most people forget the fact that I wasn't there last year and always go 'were u not here??' when I can't discuss something that happened while I was gone, because when I WAS there, they never noticed me anyway so my absence wasn't relevant to them.\n\nAnyways, idk why I put that out there lol this is far too long, but what I want to say is that sometimes it's really not you, it's the people. There are 90 people in my year, and not a single one of them is nice/cares about me enough to befriend me. Ik the problem isn't me because I've made friends in other schools and other countries, and I'd say my close circle has about 10 people scattered in different places, but I talk to them every day. Sometimes you just need to look in different places; try to make friends from other schools and so on. I only have 3 friends in this massive country, and all 3 are my neighbours and we get along great. So if nobody wants to really be friends with you, look elsewhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Sometimes other people don't like you or just don't want more friends, and it's not your fault. You're great, so seek out and choose to find those who actually deserve your friendship and company. Good luck bro!!", "Fake friends. Beware of them.

Have you ever noticed how often, with girls that you couldn\u2019t have romantic interest in, you can actually talk to them like a normal and somewhat charismatic person? \n\nEspecially as you get older, girls will make it more and more obvious when they like you back, at that point you can focus on just her once it\u2019s a done deal but there\u2019s no point putting all your eggs in one basket if the basket doesn\u2019t like you back yet. My current girlfriend was not interested in me because she wanted to focus on study and I got the hint so I stayed friends with her and didn\u2019t really mind since I still had other \u201ccrushes\u201d to go after which meant I wasn\u2019t invested. After a while of just treating her as a friend, she started liking me back when I did the simple act of genuinely caring about her as a friend and a person, not as a potential means to an end. \n\nI think our biggest problem is when we allow people to become too important in our heads without knowing if they even like us back. It ends up serving to make us spill our spaghetti everywhere because this one person alone decides (in our minds) whether we live happily ever after or die a virgin. It took me a while to learn but until you know she\u2019s into you, do not focus on her as the sole centre of the universe. Treat and think of her like any other human being who you would like to date if the opportunity arises, and try to have multiple people who you treat like this, even if it\u2019s faked to convince yourself that it\u2019s okay if she\u2019s not into you.\n\nThe last bit of advice I\u2019d like to give anyone struggling with interpersonal relationships is to at least try to genuinely care about them and show it. By this I mean ask them about themselves, their life and experiences and genuinely try to listen and care or at least seem like you do. Girls don\u2019t actually only go after assholes, you probably will notice a visible change if you ask your crush or person you want to be friends with genuine (but not forced or routine) questions about their interests and life. Bonus points if you ask them about something that you know happened to them recently, like how their performance went or something. Once you\u2019re comfortable friends with them, if they seem down or different, pull them aside or send them a text to check up on them and make sure to tell them that it\u2019s completely up to them but that you\u2019re there for them if they need someone. Do not ever hide the fact that you like them as a person, in fact try and let them know if they feel down that you value their friendship. Compliment their personality, and if you get drunk make sure to replace a drunk declaration of love with a drunk declaration of genuine positive regard, \u201cyou\u2019re a fuckin legend, you\u2019re so nice etc.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind this isn\u2019t a rulebook and only covers how you should talk to them about them. Caring about someone doesn\u2019t mean anything if it\u2019s overdone because it seems forced and can get uncomfortable if it\u2019s too much too soon. Just start conversations when you\u2019re near them with a relevant question about them or their day or something but talk about yourself too. Fr though, unless the brain feels like something\u2019s up, it fucking LOVES talking about itself, making it physically impossible to dislike someone who asks you about yourself and genuinely cares and adds to what you\u2019ve said.

Thank you all :)\n\nGirls guide to boys: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/a4oypa/the_girls_guide_to_boys_written_by_a_boy/?st=JPHH74SB&sh=c756fbdf\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey, I'm /u/reliable_teenager.\n\nIf you clicked this post, you're probably one of the people who need to read it the most.\n\nI see a lot of boys here who ask about how to talk to their crush, how to build up their confidence etc (I've done this too) and I wanted to provide a good foundation for all my bois here. In this guide I will tell you how to build your personality up and improve yourself so you can get a girlfriend.\n\n**1. Social Anxiety and Awkwardness**\n\nYou fellas need to fix up on this a lot. A subreddit that helps with this is /r/SocialSkills . No one thinks about you more than yourself and we tend to overthink ourselves in situations. You ever stay up at night thinking of all the cringy shit OTHER PEOPLE did? No. You only think about yourself. Hopefully this shows you how you overthink shit and no one cares about what shit you did in 3rd grade in 4th period math class.\n\nSo, build up your social skills, do something outside of your comfort zone even if it's for a second. For example, just ask a girl a random question or a favour - this has 2 benefits, you actually talk to a girl and practice it, and it activates a psychological effect called \"the foot in the door\" phenomenon, where they subconciously  approve of you because they did a favour for you, therefore they must think of you as a great person.\n\n**2. Confidence**\n\nConfidence is when you're happy with yourself, and KNOW that others are happy with you. It's when you know you can command respect from other people without being insecure.\n\nSometimes you need to derive confidence from an activity, and something I found that helps is going to the gym and being physically fit. You don't need to go to the gym, just do something physically active every week. Personally I weightlift in the gym 4 days a week and it's really helped my confidence. If you think it's because I'm big, think again, because I'm 5'3 and shorter than most of the boys in my grade. That doesn't stop me from being confident.\n\nA good quote I like to live by is \"Do not harm, take no shit\" Don't bully people, but take no shit from them either.\n\nA subreddit which helps me with this is /r/Confidence.\n\n**3. Have hobbies other than Netflix/Reddit/Spotify to make you interesting**\n\nIt's always good to have a hobby to make you more interesting to new people. I realised when I found out this girl who sits next to me enjoys to go hiking. It gives her a conversation topic + an outlet that she enjoys doing. You should find something that makes you different from most people, for me this is hitting the gym. Gaming doesn't count, lads. \n\nSome examples for you:\n\n- Hiking\n- Sports\n- Volunteering/Charity work\n- A club at your school\n- Programming\n\n**4. Attractiveness**\n\nWhat do you notice that all the bad boys who get good girls have? They have confidence, social skills, something that makes them feel above everyone else. They also LOOK GOOD, which you can do to.\n\nI consider myself a 6/10 on a good day, but some hobbies can make you seem more attractive - sports. Girls like someone who is physically fit, so lose those pounds and start doing some sports. /r/Fitness plug\n \nI would also recommend changing your wardrobe and your hair - they matter. Here's a good subreddit: /r/MaleFashionAdvice \n\n**5. Goals**\n\nYou need to love yourself before you start lovin' girls. This can be derived from acheiving goals. You can aim to get really good grades or aim to lose some pounds.\n\nIn order to acheive your goals, surprise, you gotta actually do shit you whacko - /r/GetDisciplined and /r/GetStudying should help, and if you want some motivation - /r/GetMotivated .\n\nHere are some goals you can try to acheive:\n\n- I will lose 20 lbs by February.\n- I will get at least 5 As in my report card.\n- I will study for an hour per day.\n- I will talk to 1-2 girls a day.\n- I will make eye contact with 5 people.\n\n**6. Faliure**\n\nFaliure is not a person, it's an event. It doesn't define you in 6 months. It's okay to fail. Got rejected by a girl? That's fine, move on. Only got a B in Geography when you studied for hours? That's fine, try some other study technique. There is always room to improve.\n\nAn example of personal faliure for me is that I failed to go the gym for 2 weeks because of laziness. I overcame this by working myself more than normal in the gym and not being lazy again.\n\nIf you fail, it's a sign that you tried. JK Rowling or whatever had to go to 12 different publishers to publish Harry Potter. Did that stop her from becoming a bestselling author? No.\n\nEvery great person failed before they became great. Michael Jordan got cut from his high school basketball team and he locked himself in his room and cried. Einstein couldn't speak until he was 4 and his teachers said he would never succeed. I went from being put in special classes in the 4th grade to becoming #1 in maths and chemistry in my high school exams. (I'm pretty great)\n\n--------------------------\n\nGirls like boys who are confident, interesting and kind.\n\nI hope this guide helped you, if you need any mo' advice you know you can message me (fuck that reddit chat).\n\n/u/reliable_teenager out", ["Thank you for coming to this ted talk", "My two moods are \u201cI\u2019m the greatest ever\u201d and \u201cnot even Jesus loves me\u201d", "So is this why chad always gets veronica and not me, the epic gamer?", " ''Actually dosen't talk to the girl he likes lika a boss''", "How do you upvote something twice?\n\nIn all seriousness, this is some good stuff man!", "*reads title*\n\n>\tGirls like boys who are...\n\n*skips to first bullet point*\n\n>social anxiety and awkwardness\n\n\u201cWell I already have that!

Also, when you talk to a therapist about self harm or thoughts of suicide, they will lock you up in a hospital until you are \u201csafe\u201d, that sounds like it\u2019s more mentally damaging than anything else (i heard that in a prison, they had something called \u201cblue burrito\u201d or something, where if you at risk they would basically make a tight \u201cburrito\u201d around you and make you lay on the floor like that all night, that wouldn\u2019t help). School counselors and/or therapists are required **by law** (at least where i live, ill just say it\u2019s in Minnesota, USA) to inform someone if you say you self harm (or are at risk of doing it), or have thoughts of suicide/attempted suicide attempts (that may have not been found out). This is counterproductive and ends up making people who struggle with this stay silent (this happened to me and now i\u2019m never serious with doctors, i\u2019ll just say i think about it sometimes but never end up or will end up doing anything). But this is a tight corner, since knowingly letting a child go home with a risk of suicide/self harm would be sort of fucked up. \n\nDepression (or related mental illnesses) is really complex, so it\u2019s hard to blame the law makers for having these rules in place.", "When I was 17 a friend of mine committed suicide.

I know the depression posts are a downer especially to those unable to truly understand but conversation with like-minded people, similar aged people are important. Be patient, be kind.

I had precocious puberty, starting at age 5 and periods at age 7, so my sexuality formed much earlier than my peers. But I trained as a peer to peer sex educator starting when I was 14, and have continued in that role both as a volunteer with the age group this reddit is for, as well as for adults. I was also a professional Domme from being 18 to 22, something that began as an interest by the time I was 9. I continue to enjoy this from time to time in my private life. \n\nPornography is something I've studied academically as part of my OU degree. Human sexuality throughout history has fascinated me since I was a kid. It's really important to remember that porn isn't inherently bad. It's not inherently harmful. But you can develop a dependency in having to using porn to be able to orgasm.  If you spend a lot of time watching a lot of porn when you're young it can be harmful. The research isn't as clearcut as many have declared in these comments, but there is a risk to some people, regardless of gender or age. \n\nYou have to remember that fetishes develop in stages, both pre-puberty and through puberty. Generally speaking fetishes aren't harmful, depending on the fetishes of course, and you shouldn't be afraid if you develop one. There are lots of people out in the world that will share your interests. But sometimes they can come a place of trauma, from having been abused in some way and really important that you find a suitable therapist to talk your way through those feelings if they distress you.\n\nI know it's hard to imagine but you must remember that your generation is the first to have such easy and free access to virtually unlimited porn online. I first had a computer and a net connection in 1995 when I was 16. Many, if not all of you, will have the opportunity to freely see porn online by the time you're 12 or 13, if you decide to look for it. We only had porn in magazines that were shared around, or found dumped in a hedge or in the park. We looked for it in books that were shared around at school, or the few people who had an early dial-up connection at home (which were slow and super expensive) might print something off to pass around school. \n\nBut we didn't have to worry about it in the same way as many of you do. It was easy not to see it or have it become this normalised way for seeing real sex. A lot of your parents simply don't understand what it's like to have so easily to hand, because it wasn't like that for us. Depending where you live and go to school you can have extremely variable sex education, which doesn't help to give you a solid perspective on what porn is, on its benefits and risks. It's not real sex. It's a performance, not real sex with real people. 95% of the time sex is not going to be like what you see in commonly found porn, even the amateur stuff.\n\nThere are some excellent sex educators freely available on YouTube, depending on what parental restrictions your parents have on what you can see online. Just remember it's normal to think about sex. It's just as normal to not be especially interested in sex. If you like masturbation great, enjoy it and learn what feels good for you. One day you'll likely need to teach someone else what you like, and that's true regardless or gender or sexuality. If you find you're not actually that bothered by sex or masturbation at all that's also normal, some people aren't. \n\nBut when it comes to porn it's important to keep in mind it's no more reality than you waking up one day to find you've become Deadpool or Harley Quinn. It's a story, like any other kind of film and real life is generally nothing like what you see on TV or online. It's messier, more awkward, more embarrassing, takes lots of talking and negotiating, needs a bit of time to figure out how you fit together and most importantly requires a lot of maturity and willingness to deal with the consequences. I had my first miscarriage at 13, in secret at home, hiding it from my parents.

If they try to force you into showing your body or try to manipulate you into doing it anyway by saying things as ''Ugh, don't be such a prude!'' or ''Don't be so boring!'' then they're probably not the right person for you. There's no rush in this sort of thing, everyone developes their sexuality at their own pace. \n\n\\- Make sure you really trust the person before you send nudes. It would be unfortunate if the person ends up sending your pictures to other people, making them public, or use them as blackmail when you break up with the person.\n\n\\- And last but not least, you don't need someone else to feel valid about your body or appearance. Showing your body can be scary! Especially if your self confidence or your self-esteem isn't that high in the first place. If you're too insecure to be sharing your nudes, don't feel pressured to do so.

Here\u2019s some advice that I wish I knew as a teenager now that I\u2019m an independent adult.", "1) School isn\u2019t going to be your whole life so don\u2019t stress about what happens too much. A lot of the people you know probably won\u2019t even see you ever again after you graduate, so don\u2019t worry what they think about you now. Few years time, you\u2019ll hardly remember their names.\n\n2) On the topic of school - study! It sucks but getting one step ahead of everyone else will prove beneficial for your future!\n\n3) Your parents are trying to juggle both full-time work and raising a kid (or multiple!). So give them a bit of slack. Maybe do the washing up, cook the dinner, sort the laundry. Even a little bit helps!\n\n4) You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing with your life? Me neither. In fact, most of us don\u2019t and are making it up as we go!\n\n5) Learn to cook! Sooner or later, you might find yourself becoming more independent and deciding what to eat for dinner is surprisingly taxing. Learn some recipes, even just basic stuff like a pasta!\n\n6) Girls aren\u2019t a different species. Also, boys aren\u2019t a different species. Don\u2019t treat them like they are.\n\n7) I learnt this one from my counsellor. Let\u2019s say kinda wanna do something but you\u2019re also worried you might not like it - say, going to a new place. Don\u2019t be afraid of not going in case you end up regretting it, you might miss out on something really fun. And if you don\u2019t like it? Nobody is stopping you from going home.\n\n8) Don\u2019t give in to peer pressure and don\u2019t do something just because your friends are doing it. Especially if it\u2019s something illegal or will break school/home rules!\n\n9) Learn how to save your money. Instead of spending it on the newest fad or some cool little feature released on your favourite game, save it up bit by bit. It helps in the long run.\n\n10) If you find yourself struggling emotionally then please find some kind of help. I didn\u2019t and I think if I did when I was younger, I probably would be a lot more emotionally stable than I am now. Seeking help isn\u2019t a bad thing and doesn\u2019t make you look weak. On the contrary, asking for help on such a personal matter is incredibly brave!", ["Noted\n\nWill forget in 4 minutes, however", "In my class a lot of people are super stressed about exams or homework and i was too until i learned that my mental health is way more important than that and i find myself pretty lucky to be the smart kid bc even if i don't study for a test I'll still get at least 50\n\nI remember 2 years ago my worst result for a test was 70 and i thought i was stupid bc its not as high as i thought it would be but now i can have 30 and still be happy about it\n\nAnyway so yeah, your mental health is much more important than good grades and if you have bad grades it doesn't mean you're stupid", "I wish posts like these were upvoted wayyy more instead of the stupid shit that this sub usually posts.", "Coming from a 22 year old. \n\nCollege isn\u2019t for everyone, you don\u2019t have to go to university if you don\u2019t want to.

So multiply both sides by X. This works because 10/X is the same as 10 divided by X. When you multiply by X you are cancelling that division sign and leaving yourself with just 10. Now that we have cancelled the X under the 10, we multiply the other side by X. This gives us 3 multiplied by X. So the problem now looks like:\n\n10 = 3X\n\nWe still don\u2019t know what X is though so we isolate it further. Again the opposite of multiplication is division. So in this case if we divide 3 times X by 3 then we are left with just X. Now on the other side we divide by 3 also. Now our problem reads:\n\n10/3 = X \n\nWe can prove that this is true because the fraction 10/3 is equal to 3.33333333\u2026. (repeating 3s forever) and we can insert that into the original problem to solve and ensure the answer checks out. \n\n10 / 3.33\u2026 = 3. This is true because 3.33\u2026 is equal to 9.99\u2026 which rounds up to 10. \n\nSecond problem:\n\nTo begin this problem we must again isolate X^3. So we subtract 30 from both sides. This cancels out the 30 on the left leaving us with X^3. The problem now reads:\n\nX^3 = 3 - 30\n\n3 - 30 = -27\n\nSo therefor,\n\nX^3 = -27\n\nNow we just work with the exponent to determine what X is equal. Working with negative numbers in exponents isn\u2019t terribly hard. In this case we have a -27 which is equal to X cubed. 27 cubed is equal to 3 as 3 x 3 = 9 x 3 = 27 \n\nSo to reach -27 we will have to multiply by negative numbers. -3 x -3 = 9 x -3 = -27. \n\nSo having cubed it we now know that:\n\nX = -3. \n\nWe can prove this by substituting:\n\n-3^3 + 30 = 3\n-27 + 30 = 3\n\nA negative number plus a positive number is equal to subtracting so -27 + 30 is equal to 30 - 27.

Here's how to bypass them (advice from an adult software engineer)", "Note: This won't completely disable it, this will just disable the logging and reporting of activity.\n\nThe key to bypassing the logging/reporting of activity by the parental controls is to reconfigure the DNS your device uses.\n\nThe way parental control services like Qustodio or Kidslox report kids activity to parents is through their API.  For example, qustodio uses api.qustodio.com to communicate child activity to parents.  If you were to cut off the line of communication to the API the parental controls use, then there won't be any way for the parental controls to transmit data to their servers, which are then shared with the parents.\n\n\nThe way to cutoff this line of communication is to configure your device's DNS settings to prohibit communication to the api/server.  To do this, you need 2 things:  the domain the parental controls use and a DNS service you can configure.  (I use NextDNS which can be used for free).  If you don't know what domain your parental controls use, just look at the DNS logs and find the parental control name in the logs and it will tell you the domain being used. \n\n\nOnce you have a DNS service ready, add  the parental control's domain to the DNS' blacklist.  Next, find the DNS settings for your device (Google how to do this on your device, but it should be under network settings or something like that).  Enter in your DNS service addresses into the DNS fields on your device, wait a few minutes for DNS to propagate, and then your parental controls will stop reporting all activity to your parents. \n\n\nNOTE:  Once you disable the DNS, reporting will resume and if an offline log is kept of your activity, it will be uploaded once the connection is reestablished, so don't disable it once it's enabled!\n\nAlso, any sites that are already blocked by the parental controls will still be blocked, it just won't be reported that you tried to go to it", ["technological restrictions raise tech-savvy kids", "the sacred texts... but then again I don't have to worry about that anymore since my parents actually respect me and I haven't had any parental controls to speak of since I was about 12 or 13", "this post needs to get to hot and educate all the poor children", "Any way to get past apple screen time restrictions?", "My parents come to my room , ask me for my phone.

If they say yes or no, you say,\" do you have any (other) tattoos?\" If they say yes, you can ask where they are. If they say no,you get a tattoo somewhere noticable,like your forearm. It doesn't need to be big, just noticable, then see if she has the same tattoo. ADVISORY: check to make sure there is no tattoo there, she could lie!

We've all heard \"we all gotta make sacrifices\" but what does this mean? It means cutting back on things that sound great in the moment but will seriously drain your bank account. A big one are nightclubs and bars. You guys are gonna reach drinking age (or depending on where you live, you already are of drinking age) and these places rely on you being too drunk to care that you just blew through half of your savings in one night. If you want to drink with your friends, do it at home, where it's not only safer but the drinks are undoubtedly far cheaper. Keep your old computer desk for a few more years, that old couch still has a few good years in it, you don't need ANY brand name clothing when the same thing is available fir 1/5th the price at another store just without the logo, do you REALLY need the next Fifa game? (No) \n\n\n2: try to live healthy: don't smoke, not only is it EXTREMELY unhealthy, but the price for those things adds up and uts only getting more and more expensive. Regular exercise and a good diet can keep you out of spending money at the hospital and veggies and fruit are far cheaper than meat. Find the veggies you like and have yourself a feast. Personally I'm 30 and I can't stand peas, green beans or cauliflower, but I LOVE pumpkin, carrots, sweet potato and corn. My meals are usually 3 parts veggies to 1 part meat and the cost is quite low. \n\n3: skilled jobs pay more: guys, go to trade school if you're not going to college, and if you are going to college, put it off and go to trade school first, use the skills and qualifications you gain to pay off your student loans till you land a good job in your chosen field. Too many people with bachelors degrees flipping burgers out there. Be someone with a bachelors degree who makes extra bank fixing pipes, wiring, roofs and doing landscaping. \n\nPay is determined by the value of your labour, the value of your labour is determined by the availability of those with your skill set, it's the classic rule of supply and demand. Low demand with high supply means lower value (eg: fast food wirkers), higher demand but lower availability means you're the one making bank. Learn to be a plumber or an electrician or a power line worker, usually the more unpleasant and skill-demanding the job, the higher paying. The reason that McDonald's pays next to dirt is because the skills needed to work there are so abundant that the value of it is low. HOWEVER, sewerage plant workers and those with the skills and willingness to climb into and fix septic tanks are jobs that require skill, require knowledge and require the will to do it. Very few people have all three and that's why they're so damn expensive. Because they can name their own price and like it or not, the customer has to pay it or their sewer system will remain all jacked up, and most people will sell their organs rather than let that problem sit and fester. \n\nAlso night shift, very few people are willing to work night shift, this makes night shift work pay CONSIDERABLY higher than regular day shift jobs. \n\nThe downsides to these jobs are those \"sacrifices\" I mentioned earlier as well. \n\n4: manage your money: get a banking app. If your bank doesn't have an app, find a new bank. Of course just saying \"manage it\" isn't helpful so, for an example, let me tell you how I manage my money. \n\nI have 3 bank accounts, one is my \"rainy day account\" one is my \"savings\" and one is my \"spending\" all of my pay goes straight into my savings, all my bills and rent are paid via this account too by direct debit. \n\nMy \"rainy day\" account receives an automatic $50 transfer to I from my savings every fortnight. This account goes untouched unless needed and receives extra input from my savings when I feel there's some extra in my savings I can put away. \n\nThe spending account is only to have money that is directly transfered from the savings account via the app. That way I can control how much money I can spend at any given time, and how much is left in my savings after each transfer so I can keep track of my spending and endure that I am almost always operating at a net gain. \n\n3 years ago, I was delivering pizzas and had about 3K to my name. Today, with the tips I've told you about here and working as a night patrol security guard, i have 15K in my savings, 17K in my rainy day and $70 in my spending account. \n\nJust as costs for things can pile up, if you stop and think about how much you're spending and budget accordingly, so can your savings. \n\nGood luck you kids, some lessons you'll learn the hard way but i hope one day you think back on what you've read here and it helps you even in a small way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: wow this thing really blew up! Thank you all. \n\nFor some info, I am NOT a qualified financial advisor. I am simply a guy who in the last 12 years since leaving highschool has learned a thing or two about handling money. Yes, some of this stuff is obvious when you read it but, sometimes the most obvious things elude us till someone points them out. \n\nOther adults in this thread do disagree with me. They've had different life experiences and come to different conclusions than I have. This is fair, but this is what I've found works for me. \n\nAlso some people have accused me of telling you kids to live miserable lives to pursue an endless hustle by my \"sacrifices\" bit. I'm not. I'm telling you to not blow large amounts of money on frivolous things that'll send you bankrupt. Spend your money on things that'll make you happy, just be careful not to overspend. I fully endorse the \"wait a week and see if you still want it\" method. That's solid advice.\n\nSecond edit: made a paragraph about investment advice. It was indeed bad advice in retrospect and i didn't want to share bad advice to you guys.

Not everyone is a pedo", "I am 28 and currently have ~$80k in my savings. I have a few things to add to this.\n\n1.\tif you go to college, start at a community college and transfer to a four year after you finish. I saved tens of thousands because I was paying $2000 for a yea of school when my friends were paying $10,000+ in the same year. It took me 6 years in total to get my bachelors but I finished debt free.\n2.\tFind a job that does tuition reimbursement. Places like UPS, Starbucks and currently Walmart and Target will fund your degree 100% at particular colleges or give you $5,000 a year for any college you pick.\n3.\tGet a degree in a field that actually has jobs. STEM and Technology will get you way farther in life than an art degree or psychology degree. I know scores of people with the latter degrees not in their field making barely above minimum wage. Get a CS degree and you can become a Developer for 70-90k straight out of college.\n4.\tIf you pay for a phone plan, go prepaid. Verizon costs $55/ month for 5gb data and unlimited everything post paid and will slam fees on you whenever they want. Verizon prepaid is $25-$40/month for the same 5gb plan. Over the course of years I have saved $5,000+ on a phone bill.\n5.\tBuy things outright, don\u2019t get loans or have places run credit. Buy a new iPhone in cash and keep it 3 years, buy a used reliable low maintenance car and drive it for a few years. \n6.\tThe main priority nowadays is to stay out of debt. Don\u2019t spend what you don\u2019t have. I\u2019m 28 with no debt and I am approved for a larger mortgage than my friends with spouses who make more money than me. Why? Because they have car loans, student loans and bad spending habits. \n7.\tEstablish credit, get a credit card and only use it for something small like gas or groceries and pay it off immediately.

There is usually a limit to the number of transactions you can make out of a savings account, which is what makes it different than a checking account and it's why the bank gives you more interest on a savings account. You should keep the majority of your money in a savings account and then transfer the amount you need for bills each month into your checking account.\n\n\nDon't use the major banks like bank of America or Wells Fargo, they're a scam. Use a smaller better rated bank or, even better, a credit union.\n\n\nAlso, in the US, our credit system is fucked up and cruel (vote for people that want to nationalize it), but you will have an easier time if you start building your credit history young. As long as you have self control, get a no annual fee cash back credit card and spend it only like the money in your wallet and fully pay it off every month. It's essentially like getting 1-2 percent off everything in life and those without credit cards basically pay a premium for the rest of those that have them. If you can't control your spending though and end up paying interest, you're losing and should cut up the card, so only spend what you already have! Once a year, ask them to increase your credit limit too.

It's been a long 7 years of being on reddit.  After finally settling down into this account after various attempts to leave social media, I've decided to stay and just enjoy what Reddit has brought to me over the years, now i'm just reflecting. (NSFW for some content)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've stumbled across Reddit when I was 13 and I've made various friends here from this exact thread, most of who I no longer speak to, other's a faint memory and maybe indulged in some childish puppy love long distance flings and relationships that came and went over the years. I've gathered a lot of information from reddit and through my experiences in real life and this will be the last summer of me being an official teen. My 20th birthday is around the corner and I figured, if i'm going out, might as well go out with some advice to leave behind that may or may not be useful. A lot of you are going through what I went through at one point and I just want to say, being a teenager is a challenging time, life changes in so many different ways and towards the end of your teenagehood you start to reflect and realize things in a different light... so here's my knowledge passed down to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- If you're in high school in the U.S, you really only have two chances to slip up. After 9th and 10th grade, you have little room to mess up and your GPA in 11th and 12th grade will affect what colleges you get into, be wise about how you spend your time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- If you decide to go to college, I highly recommend going to community college, getting your associates and then transferring out to a 4 year. You'll save thousands in tuition and it's easier to transfer into the school of your choice from CC if you had bad grades in H.S or didn't get in the first time around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- With that being said, community college isn't a bad thing. Yeah you'll be at home and commuting but not going to a four year off the bat doesn't make you less of a person. Community Colleges allow you a little more time to become resourceful, catch up on academics and mature emotionally, without community college I would have completely flunked out of a 4 year university. No one will look down on you for attending one, some people with doctorates and masters have started out in community college. It's not how you get to your goal, what matters is that you didn't give up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-  Just because it's your first job doesn't mean you have to stay there and deal with work place bullying or being in an environment that drains you. Quit. Your mental health will thank you and more opportunities will be waiting for you. It's a job, not a career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your very first love is not your last.  You will love again, you just need time to heal. Surround yourself around friends and family, it helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- If they cheat, don't take them back, they will do it again. Trust is hard to build and you will drive yourself crazy trying to convince yourself that you can trust someone who has completely shattered your self confidence, view on love and relationship. Leave, immediately. I promise you, karma will give them theirs and you'll heal within due time and move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- If they seem disinterested after several attempts to move beyond the friendship level, drop it. Focus your attention elsewhere. It's not worth the heart break and agony of unrequited love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Befriend at least one or two teachers in high school that you're comfortable with. Networking now can help you in college and even after high school, trust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Don't blow your paycheck on eating out. Set aside 50 dollars from every check every week, just in case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your parents are also going through a hard time, they're getting older and dealing with their bodies aging physically as well as dealing with their child growing distant, fussy and independent. They may fuss and piss you off, but they love you. You'll butt heads now but sometime through college or maybe in your 20's you'll realize they did they best they could in undesirable fashions because they loved you and no one else taught them how. They're trying their best, communicate with them. Appreciate them. Say sorry when you're wrong, they cry when you hurt their feelings too. They won't be here forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You'll grow out of friendships all the time, don't think you need to hang onto a friendship because of the history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Making friends in College may be harder than making friends in high school, but you'll come across those 1-2 people that will become your friends for a lifetime, don't lose hope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Use condoms and get tested after every new and old sexual partner you encounter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Learn how to change a tire and buy a car jack if you have car, sh\\*t happens on the road and tow trucks are expensive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Bring lunch from home when going to work. It'll save you money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-  Mental health is important, if you feel like you have no one to talk to in your family about how you're feeling, reach out to a friend and their parents, or a trusted adult or counselor, they may be able to point you to resources such as therapy that is affordable in your means or free counseling services if you're a minor and have parents that are ANTI therapy for whatever reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Life get's better, s\\*icide isn't the answer. This is cliche to say but as a survivor of 3 failed suicide attempts, I can testify that life really does get better. Please, talk to someone, anyone. Somebody loves you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Don't walk around with the assumption that anything you post online is private, be mindful of what you share and who you share it with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You don't need a relationship to validate your worth. Loneliness decreases once you realize that alone time isn't sad or deprecating. Enjoy your own company, enjoy the silence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Saying No is fine. You don't need to explain beyond that, No is No. Speak up and set boundaries when needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Don't try to plan your whole life out, life happens. People get pregnant, people get ill, people fall into financial hardship, people become depressed, people become disinterested and take time off to find what they want to do in life-Nothing will stay solid, you won't have your life figured out at 16 or even 20 and graduating college. Don't stress it because no one has it figured it out, take it one step at time. You'll discover as you go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Seek help when you can no longer do it all by yourself. You can never be too prideful to ask for help, just ask, someone is always waiting to help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your political views will change over time, you don't need to stay loyal to a party or thought process you once agreed or disagreed with, you have the right to change opinions as knowledge is gained. Screw who ever disagrees with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Go to that movie, go to that party, go to that festival. Soon you'll be swarmed by thesis papers and due dates, work clouding your weekends and having no energy to actually go out when you're off. Enjoy your free time, take advantage of every social event while you can. Burn out isn't healthy and you're going to regret not having just lived.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-  Your attitude when you wake up sets the tone for the day. Nothing is worth holding onto, let it go and breathe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-  Don't let your family, any adult or friends co-erce you into a major, a university or even a job you don't like or want. You have the right to say no and go on your own path. It's your life, not theirs. They can eat dirt for all that matters. Do what your gut is calling you to do. You'll thank yourself later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Not going to college is fine, trade school and various other options are out there and valid. A degree does not make you human or happy, doing what you desire to do, will make you happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Don't get a credit card on your own, not even the student ones- just don't. See if your parents can make you an authorized user under theirs. They can set a monthly limit and your credit score will automatically go up assuming they have good credit already. If not, just don't get the damn credit card. Stick to a checking and savings account. Interest WILL bite you in the ass later on. It's not worth it. Enjoy being debt free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Now, if you are financially responsible and you can handle credit well, by all means get a credit card and only spend what you can afford on a monthly basis. Frequent payments can help boost your score by 10-15 points. NEVER pay late. Some people aren't able to have their parents make them authorized users under their  parents accounts and some people want to start building credit early. This is all fine if you can handle the responsibility. Building credit will help you in the long run, I just don't recommend it if you have no idea how it works and rush into it like I did. Some are better at things than others, credit card companies aren't evil but I don't advise getting one just to get one either now that you've turned 18. Do your research first and foremost, ask around and make sure you have some income to be able to pay your bill. Good credit will benefit you later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand last but not least.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't take a fucking 8 am lecture in college ever.\n\nDon't do it.\n\nJust don't fucking do it.\n\nYou think you can do it, but you won't.\n\nYou'll sleep in EVERY single time.\n\nDon't do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand don't pick up the phone from your job on your day offs. Once in a while sure, but enjoy your rest days. You'll need them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know my advice may be meaningless to some but I hope someone got something out of this horribly written thread.\n\nFarewell r/Teenagers. I've grown and made countless memories here... now i'm on to the big boy threads... Here's to 20 and my crippling credit card debt that I mismanaged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck everyone, and best wishes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-bcf\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD!!!!!!!!!!! I'M SO PUMPED.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: I know certain pointers here don't apply to everyone and everyone has different situations in life. I tried to give advice from my perspective based off of what I learned in the best way that I could-- we won't all have the same path in life. Not all of us will go to college, some will go to a 4 year straight away, some people don't have a relationship with their parents, some people are really good at managing credit, some people won't ever have sex and some people won't have someone to reach out to when their mental health is struggling.

I highly disagree with that. If your parents dont want to make you a authorized user and you have no choice but to get your own then get your own!! There is no interest on credit cards if you use them responsibly. Pay them back before the due date religiously and as long as you dont have annual fees( you normally dont want cards with annual fees anyways) you'll actually be paying less than what you spent since almost all of them have 1% cash backs or points or something like that. Plus building your credit early is so important for when your ready for the big purchases in life such as a house! TREAT IT LIKE A DEBIT CARD. if you dont have the money dont buy it with your credit card. Credit card debt is a slippery slope but if used wisely they can be a extremely powerful tool that can save you money every month while building your credit.

It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified and the enzymes of either rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese.\\[1\\] Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout.Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are currently produced in various countries. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged for. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries. A cheesemonger, or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting the cheeses, purchasing, receiving, storing and ripening them.\\[2\\]  \nFor a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei, but others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs.  \nCheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese.\\[3\\] Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, last longer than soft cheeses, such as Brie or goat's milk cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable. Vacuum packaging of block-shaped cheeses and gas-flushing of plastic bags with mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in the 21st century.\\[3\\]", "Keep yo real ones on speed dial \ud83e\udd76", "Eat them", "1.

Some encouragement and 20 tips from a MD PHD in Psychiatry and Neuroscience who is rooting for all of you.", "Hello Fam. I\u2019m a MD PHD (MD degree, finalizing training psychiatry,  PhD in Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology) and felt the desire to give y\u2019all a shoutout. Being a teenager sucks.  Looking back on it, I remember people saying \u201cthese are the best years of your life.\u201d  Let me tell you friends, nothing could be further from the truth.  The happiest time in the life of someone from N. America is 65 years old.  The amount of happiness you find during your teenage years hardly registers in studies they have done looking at happiness.  Teenagers have an impossible task.  Keep up with ever changing trends, battle raging hormones, get up for school earlier than is healthy, keep up with all pop culture, all funny memes (this effort is worth it), ace all of their classes, do one billion extra curriculars , never do anything embarrassing, be there for your friends, get a job and earn money.  On top of this, you have very little control over your schedule, your free time, or the $$$ you have access to to accomplish all of this.  Honestly, you all do so much and I\u2019m constantly impressed that anyone makes it out of these years even somewhat functionally. \n\nBelow are a list of 20 tips I wish that I would have been told and things I tell struggling teenagers that I have worked with. \n\n\n1.) High school , for most people, is not the \u201cbest time in your life.\u201d  Instead, it is like some weird dream that you will look back on and say to yourself \u201cwhat the heck was that all about.\u201d  College is way cooler and people generally accept people as they are there.  Just hold on to get to this point.\n\n2.) Popularity now does not equate to success later.  Not even close.  Literally no one I know talks about there sucks in high school.  You only find out accidentally that someone was a cheerleader or a football quarterback back in the day.  No one cares.  In fact if you talk about this stuff after high-school you are considered a looser.\n\n3.) Relation status (or lack thereof) does not predict happiness in your future life. Being single all or most of high-school may seem like the end of the world but honestly, you may have spared yourself a lot of drama with STDs and pregnancy scares.  I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t try to date, but trust me, I\u2019d you can\u2019t or just don\u2019t, it is more than ok.\n\n4.) Grades matter but the work ethic you develop to get good grades matters more.  A genius  who never studies but gets a 3.9 is worse off to someone who works there but off and pulls a 3.4.  My money is on the second one to be successful.\n\n5.) The band nerds, the theater \u201cpeeps\u201d, the weird music and the Dungeons and Dragon folks are having way more fun than the popular kids stressing out about their looks and the drama of those social circles.  Trust me, I\u2019ve been on both sides of the fence.\n\n6.) Reach out to that weird kid and you may make an authentic friend. If you are that weird kid, reach out to others.  \n\n7.) People will not likely call you to do things. Get over it and call others to hang out.  Just because you are always the person that initiated things doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have friends.  There are many many people just waiting for someone to call them to initiate things.  You can become popular just by being that person.\n\n8.) Friends fade but good relationships with your siblings can last a lifetime \n\n9.) If you feel hopeless, serve someone.  You will find meaning and forget your problems for a while.  My high school life changes when I made a goal to find someone new to uplift each day.\n\n10.) Instead of gossip, speak positively behind people\u2019s back to others.  This will genuinely help others see you as a cool and positive person to be around.\n\n11.) Confidence is learned not inherently possessed by someone.   Put yourself out there, fail with glory and hold your head up, and it will come.\n\n12.) If someone makes fun of you saying \u201cnot cool\u201d is one of the best defenses.  Then keep making fun of how not cool making fun of others is.  It will reach deep past their narcissism to the insecure core of their narcissism and they will back off.\n\n13.) Your potential will not be realized during your teenage years.  Instead, work on habits that will last well beyond these weird years (exercise, learning to make and keep friends, hobbies, music interests, video games you love, service you can be involved with, causes to join, the love of reading).\n\n14.) Half of your anxiety is bad sleep behaviors.  Literally half.  If you need to, have someone take your phone at a certain time each night.\n\n15.) Half of good grades involves three things.  Attend and be engaged in each class, turn in every assignment completed, and let your teacher know your trying for good grades.  You would be surprised how much the third one helps as they will cut you some slack if you make a mistake, give you tips and even grade you more kindly. \n\n16.)

If you think you struggle with mental health, reach out now.  We joke about swing psychiatrist and therapists but honestly, I\u2019ve seen people go from being completely depressed feeling that life was pointless, who after the right medication combo and therapy sessions be able to laugh and joke and smile and look forward to the future. \n\n20.)  Stress is going to happen in your life. Especially in the life of a teenager.  Your body makes cortisol when it is stressed. That cortisol cannot be resolved without physical activity and will build and build, leading to more stress. Exercise isn\u2019t just an \u201coutlet\u201d it is literally helping to resolve a hormone in your body that leads to stress and anxiety.  Good regular sleep also helps to resolve that cortisol. \n\nTL/DR:  It gets better.  Please invest the time to read through all of this.

About two months ago I started going to therapy because my friend called the police saying that they were worried for my safety. The police knocked on my dads door at 3 in the morning to make sure I was still alive. This event led to a lot of conversations and an agreement that we were to find a pyschiatrist/therapist to fix me. I have been depressed for over a year now and I don\u2019t what to do. My family and friends think I\u2019m doing better with the therapy, but I honestly don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s helping anymore. Every week I get a little bit more down. And then I have a session and then by the end of the week I\u2019m back to feeling the same way as I used to. Which usually ends in me cutting or taking way too much aspirin. All this while I\u2019ve been developing feelings for the friend who saved my life. I told her once before, but then we just shrugged it off and didn\u2019t say too much about it. I recently brought it up again yesterday and after her asking me what I meant and me explaining it, she doesn\u2019t reply. Not only that, she blocks me. Even the girl that saved my life from myself doesn\u2019t want to speak with me anymore. Now, I\u2019m so numb I want to skip my online classes, but I can\u2019t even close my own door to my bedroom because my mom just assumes I\u2019m cutting again. Idk what to do and I probably shouldn\u2019t have said this in comments of a Reddit post. I just wish I could turn my life back a few years. And then I remember that the past wasn\u2019t any better.

I'd occasionally sleep as well because I already had sleep problems. 6 hours later I could go home and in front of the computer with friends was the only place I felt, I could have fun.\n\nAlmost a year later in August of 2017, I could finally move to the special ed class. And the second I recognized some the students' faces there, I was so happy. There were finally some people, I could talk to, and understand. That's not to say I didn't like anyone from my old class. I have 2 guys who I still talk to today. \n\nThe only problem left was the education part. Yes, I had finally gotten what i wanted in terms of social life, but education only seemed easy for me in 1st through 3rd and some of 4th grade, where I saw myself as the best at most things. Entering the new special ed class, it was wierd for me thinking that I wasn't as good as I thought. \n\nAnyways, 6th and 7th grade came and went for me but 8th grade became a shitshow far too early.
