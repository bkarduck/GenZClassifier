This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this)\n\n2012, AT&T - tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.\n\n2013, Verizon literally stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the net neutrality rules in place.\n\nThe foundation of argument is that Net Neutrality is unnecessary because we've never had issues without it.

By late December, it was confirmed to be a highly contagious viral disease.\n\nIn the 16 months since then, we've seen the world's scientists mobilise, analyse the virus, devise not one, but several vaccinations and discover mitigating treatments.  Production facilities ramped up to create millions upon millions of doses.  Those doses are now going into human beings at an unprecedented rate.  In many, many places, the rate of infection and death is tumbling *despite* all this taking place during a climate crisis, with substantial parts of the world's population disbelieving in the disease and rejecting the vaccine, resulting in the rapid mutation of the original virus in several countries.\n\nAnd the scientists are back at it, analysing those, determining which will be covered by existing vaccines and which will need new ones.\n\nHas it been perfect?  Hell no:  nothing is when humans have to organise it -- ask Terry Pratchett.  And yet... and yet....  Here I am, a mere 16 months later, with a sore arm, and a piece of paper telling me when to go back for my second dose, and a pretty decent understanding of what has happened, where, why and how.\n\nI've been digging around in recent historical material and can find nothing, anywhere, to match this achievement.  The first flu shot was not given until 1942, for example, 24 years after the Spanish Flu epidemic.  And it is down to rapid digital communication and scientific teamwork across borders.  Yes, there have been those who have lied, spun and attempted/are still attempting, to shift the narrative and lay blame.  With humans, there always are.\n\nBut, let's take just a minute to be awed by what  has been accomplished in just 16 months. It really is a miracle.", ["The other incredibly positive aspect to all this that everyone glosses over is how lucky we have been that the virus has had relatively little effect on children.\n\nHad it behaved like a typical coronavirus we would in all likelihood have double the death toll with all of the additional deaths being young people and children.\n\nAs terrible as things have been, they could have very easily been incalculably worse.", "I share your optimism, OP.\n\nFor context, I'm a qualitative researcher who does international research at a large scale. So I go into people's homes around the world to talk to them about why they do or don't do things and then try to make sense of it. ha!\n\nWhat I've learned in my almost 25 years of doing this: people are mostly good. Globally we share common goals. My time in the field has made me more optimistic about humanity, not less.\n\nIn 2019 I was in the Philippines, Colombia, Brasil, Mexico, Indonesia, India (twice), Italy, Germany, the UK (3 times?), Turkey, Russia and maybe a few somewhere elses (the Netherlands?) oh and I'm American. So, ya know, places that are culturally measurably different from one another.\n\nAnd I remain optimistic. I really do.\n\nEdit 4/30: to those asking about my field: I'm what's called a user experience researcher. I'm probably one of the most senior people out there doing it or at least among them; it's a multi-discplinarian field that pulls from psychology (cognitive, neuro, social), anthropology, sociology, business analysis, etc. - when I first started out were called by other titles (information architects, some other things) and it's evolved over the years. To be great at my job you have to be really good at listening, asking thoughtful questions, and knowing the difference between what people say and what they mean (and how to navigate between the two). \n\nAt this point in my career I do very strategic research to answer big questions about the nature of how people do/don't do or think about things. And I work at a global scale - exceedingly rare among even my peers. My work is mainly to help businesses figure out what products or services to grow into for the future (3-5 year timeline). \n\nWhen I'm in the field I talk to regular people (at this point it's probably thousands?) - poor, middle income, working class, affluent, whatever. Usually non-English speaking (via simultaneous translation, since I only speak 2 langauges), all education levels, all genders, all ages, rural/suburban/urban, all kinds of folks. So I get to see a real cross-section of humanity. And here's some of what I've learned over the years: \n\n* the overwhelming majority of people just want to have a decent paying job so they can provide adequately for their families, save a little, take a vacation once in awhile, and be safe. they want some agency over their work and want to be treated fairly for it\n* they want to be able to do better for their kids and provide opportunities for them; healthcare is always important\n* most people have good hustle\n* they want to be liked by others and considered helpful, they want to be kind to others\n* they don't want to be hurt or hurt others\n* with or without money, sadness hits everywhere\n* also, it costs a lot of money to be poor. a LOT. I don't think people who haven't been poor or seen it up close understand this. the world would be a really different place if everyone did.\n* being able to read and write in local language is ticket to a better life\n* having English language skills is like being gifted from Zeus, it's a real leg up no matter where in the world you are\n\nI'm sure I'm missing a lot but this is what's coming to me from the hip on a Friday morning.

I asked the family to come over in one car under cover of darkness as a favor to me so I could avoid the contempt, but some people had to leave early to go to work, or X is mad at Y, blah blah blah.

They slowed, nearly to a stop, as it was approaching rush hour and there was a long line of traffic ahead merging into a single lane as they approached the construction. The car behind them, driven by a young man who was on his way home from work, tired and distracted, did not stop. My wife\u2019s car was struck from the rear at a speed in excess of 75 MPH. The entire back half of the car, where my son was in his car seat, was crushed. He was airlifted to hospital, but unfortunately had suffered severe head and neck trauma and did not survive.\n\nThe young man was charged with reckless driving, as Michigan does not have a \u2018vehicular manslaughter\u2019 type of offense, and served a few weeks in county jail.

But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now: pity.\n\nHowever bad things are for most other rich democracies, it is hard not to feel sorry for Americans. Most of them did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Yet they are locked down with a malignant narcissist who, instead of protecting his people from Covid-19, has amplified its lethality. The country Trump promised to make great again has never in its history seemed so pitiful.\n\nWill American prestige ever recover from this shameful episode? The US went into the coronavirus crisis with immense advantages: precious weeks of warning about what was coming, the world\u2019s best concentration of medical and scientific expertise, effectively limitless financial resources, a military complex with stunning logistical capacity and most of the world\u2019s leading technology corporations. Yet it managed to make itself the global epicentre of the pandemic.\n\nAs the American writer George Packer puts it in the current edition of the Atlantic, \u201cThe United States reacted ... like Pakistan or Belarus \u2013 like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.\u201d\n\nIt is one thing to be powerless in the face of a natural disaster, quite another to watch vast power being squandered in real time \u2013 wilfully, malevolently, vindictively. It is one thing for governments to fail (as, in one degree or another, most governments did), quite another to watch a ruler and his supporters actively spread a deadly virus. Trump, his party and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News became vectors of the pestilence.\n\nThe grotesque spectacle of the president openly inciting people (some of them armed) to take to the streets to oppose the restrictions that save lives is the manifestation of a political death wish. What are supposed to be daily briefings on the crisis, demonstrative of national unity in the face of a shared challenge, have been used by Trump merely to sow confusion and division. They provide a recurring horror show in which all the neuroses that haunt the American subconscious dance naked on live TV.\n\nIf the plague is a test, its ruling political nexus ensured that the US would fail it at a terrible cost in human lives. In the process, the idea of the US as the world\u2019s leading nation \u2013 an idea that has shaped the past century \u2013 has all but evaporated.\n\nOther than the Trump impersonator Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, who is now looking to the US as the exemplar of anything other than what not to do? How many people in D\u00fcsseldorf or Dublin are wishing they lived in Detroit or Dallas?\n\nIt is hard to remember now but, even in 2017, when Trump took office, the conventional wisdom in the US was that the Republican Party and the broader framework of US political institutions would prevent him from doing too much damage. This was always a delusion, but the pandemic has exposed it in the most savage ways.\n\nAbject surrender\n\nWhat used to be called mainstream conservatism has not absorbed Trump \u2013 he has absorbed it. Almost the entire right-wing half of American politics has surrendered abjectly to him. It has sacrificed on the altar of wanton stupidity the most basic ideas of responsibility, care and even safety.\n\nThus, even at the very end of March, 15 Republican governors had failed to order people to stay at home or to close non-essential businesses. In Alabama, for example, it was not until April 3rd that governor Kay Ivey finally issued a stay-at-home order.\n\nIn Florida, the state with the highest concentration of elderly people with underlying conditions, governor Ron DeSantis, a Trump mini-me, kept the beach resorts open to students travelling from all over the US for spring break parties. Even on April 1st, when he issued restrictions, DeSantis exempted religious services and \u201crecreational activities\u201d.\n\nGeorgia governor Brian Kemp, when he finally issued a stay-at-home order on April 1st, explained: \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that [the virus can be spread by people without symptoms] until the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nThis is not mere ignorance \u2013 it is deliberate and homicidal stupidity. There is, as the demonstrations this week in US cities have shown, plenty of political mileage in denying the reality of the pandemic. It is fuelled by Fox News and far-right internet sites, and it reaps for these politicians millions of dollars in donations, mostly (in an ugly irony) from older people who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\nIt draws on a concoction of conspiracy theories, hatred of science, paranoia about the \u201cdeep state\u201d and religious providentialism (God will protect the good folks) that is now very deeply infused in the mindset of the American right.\n\nTrump embodies and enacts this mindset, but he did not invent it. The US response to the coronavirus crisis has been paralysed by a contradiction that the Republicans have inserted into the heart of US democracy. On the one hand, they want to control all the levers of governmental power. On the other they have created a popular base by playing on the notion that government is innately evil and must not be trusted.\n\nThe contradiction was made manifest in two of Trump\u2019s statements on the pandemic: on the one hand that he has \u201ctotal authority\u201d, and on the other that \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all\u201d. Caught between authoritarian and anarchic impulses, he is incapable of coherence.\n\nFertile ground\n\nBut this is not just Donald Trump. The crisis has shown definitively that Trump\u2019s presidency is not an aberration. It has grown on soil long prepared to receive it. The monstrous blossoming of misrule has structure and purpose and strategy behind it.\n\nThere are very powerful interests who demand \u201cfreedom\u201d in order to do as they like with the environment, society and the economy. They have infused a very large part of American culture with the belief that \u201cfreedom\u201d is literally more important than life. My freedom to own assault weapons trumps your right not to get shot at school. Now, my freedom to go to the barber (\u201cI Need a Haircut\u201d read one banner this week in St Paul, Minnesota) trumps your need to avoid infection.\n\nUsually when this kind of outlandish idiocy is displaying itself, there is the comforting thought that, if things were really serious, it would all stop. People would sober up. Instead, a large part of the US has hit the bottle even harder.\n\nAnd the president, his party and their media allies keep supplying the drinks. There has been no moment of truth, no shock of realisation that the antics have to end. No one of any substance on the US right has stepped in to say: get a grip, people are dying here.\n\nThat is the mark of how deep the trouble is for the US \u2013 it is not just that Trump has treated the crisis merely as a way to feed tribal hatreds but that this behaviour has become normalised. When the freak show is live on TV every evening, and the star is boasting about his ratings, it is not really a freak show any more. For a very large and solid bloc of Americans, it is reality.\n\nAnd this will get worse before it gets better. Trump has at least eight more months in power. In his inaugural address in 2017, he evoked \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d and promised to make it stop. But now that the real carnage has arrived, he is revelling in it. He is in his element.\n\nAs things get worse, he will pump more hatred and falsehood, more death-wish defiance of reason and decency, into the groundwater. If a new administration succeeds him in 2021, it will have to clean up the toxic dump he leaves behind. If he is re-elected, toxicity will have become the lifeblood of American politics.\n\nEither way, it will be a long time before the rest of the world can imagine America being great again.\n\n\n\n---", ["Good opinion piece.

The beginning of troubles. We\u2019ve got climate change with mass migration coming; more frequent and extreme weather events; mass blackouts; more probable viral diseases, and so much more on the horizon.\n\nMy advice to the average American is to do the following - understand that America is not a third world county - it\u2019s a country currently hobbled\nby decades worth of corrosive ideology and the byproduct is being seen glaringly. \n\nDo what you can to help your countrymen and government, because for the love of god, things HAVE been far worse despite what the people on Reddit say.

Further, it is odd that the author chose to focus on the red states when the pandemic has been more or less limited to the blue states, which endorse the same policies I am sure this author does.  Forcing nursing homes to take back positive covid cases in NY killed people.  The WHO/CDC telling people masks don't helped killed people.  Telling Trump that closing the borders is racist killed people.  NYC still to this day running the subway killed people.\n\nOur president is not all powerful and we see that every day in the blue states that flaunt federal efforts on things like immigration.  Trump did what the federal government should have done - he got ventilators and hospital beds ready and no person in the US went without.  It was up to the governors and local officials to define how to handle it beyond that and talking about locksdowns and testing being the cure all flies in the face of the which is nearly herd immunity and the antibody tests in the US showing those efforts here have been completely ineffective.\n\nThis pandemic can be blamed on two things: the Chinese Communist Party and Globalization.  Two things Trump has continuously warned the world about.  He was right, just admit that fact.\n\nLastly, no one cares about your 'pity'.  In fact, outside of your advice on the best way to cook a potato, I really have no interest in anything you have to say.  Prior to the pandemic, Trump delivered on every promise of 'Making America Great Again'.  Now, he did not create a dystopia world of rampant racism.  He created a system that placed American First and it uplifted every segment of the population.  He don't hate Trump for his failures, you hate Trump for his successes.  You hate him that it proved all your assumptions wrong.  Trump did bring back manufacturing jobs, Trump could renegotiate trade deals more in the US favor, Trump could stop the US from engaging in endless wars.  These fly in the face of globalist, liberal mindset.  This is especially true for Ireland where your economy is based on being a tax haven and tourism from the US and China.  Let's see how well that works out for you going forward.\n\nFreedom has a price - a price the people of Canada and Ireland were never willing to pay.  So while you gladly give up your few remaining rights to protect yourself from a pandemic with worse outcomes than a country that did nothing like Sweden, some people have a different system of values.  You should have learned from history - and that Union Jack should be a bitter reminder - that governments love authoritarian rule and will not give up power once you give it to them.  People deserve the government they have and your people have chose your path.

That is NOT healthy, a healthy balance is the goal I think.  \n\n\nI  always need to be grateful for  what was provided for me and while I'm tempted to point out people who had more (which is a terrible insult to the person providing).\n\nI can see that a man who does not necessarily get along well with children of certain ages could choose work over family while justifying that he was doing what needed to be done while providing a stay at home mom for the kids development. And if the kids are driving you nuts ( and they do at times certainly, I can see myself picking an escape like this )\n\nI can look at the stories of my Dad growing up, his dad never did things with him, the things i look back and wish we had done together, he just never had the skills, or did not feel comfortable or whatever, but I wish I had a dad who showed me stuff. When the time came for me to learn how to use tools or operate things, or fix stuff, there was no guidance. To be honest there was a story about him showing my mom how to drive standard transmission and quickly losing patience so perhaps i was spared shitty, impatient instruction and left to find my own way, which may have been better. \n\nI guess that if i expect him to have taught me things like that i would be expecting him to do things he just didn't have the skills to do, and to accept that.\n\nAs has been said, is that in growing up, we feel that our parents let us down in ways and then as we learn we hopefully find that we end up forgiving them for not being the perfect parents we selfishly demanded of them and accepting them and seeing all of the ways they did show us love and the sacrifices they made.", "Your dad was like a whole lot of other dads.

It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\n>As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\n>In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. \n\n>Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. \n\n>Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks. \n\nSorry for your loss", "When my dad passed it was pretty surreal for me.

It was probably 2 years since the last time I had seen him in person when my mom called me saying that some lab results were \"really bad\" and she was driving him to the hospital. Seeing him in the hospital bed, thinner and weaker than any mental concept of \"dad\" allowed for, was like a bad nightmare.\n\nI was consistently impressed by his desire to not let his illness compromise the things he cared about. He was a \"live to work\" kind of guy and I still remember him asking the ICU nurses to turn off the various beeps so he could join a conference call, and them, shaking their heads at someone who seemed to care more about pretending he was ok than resting and relaxing.\n\nHe was brave and definitive when he was staring down the end. He didn't want dialysis or a ventilator or a transplant that might have saved his life. \"I'm old enough, someone else should get it\" was the only thing he had to say on the topic. Easy enough to follow his wishes, hard to understand them all the time. I still don't know if this was obstinance and denial or a wise and mature acceptance of the reality of his situation. Probably a combination of the two.\n\nI learned a lot of lessons from dad, some of them on what to do and some on what not to do.

For years I have been craving \"The old internet\".  Especially the social frontier it started, but before it got to,  this.  Not to bad mouth anyone or technology, but it was more special then.   It was more special when it was not so mainstream, more difficult to some, and not so popular, to get \"connected\".\n\nIt may be partly to my upbringing, but I lived a pretty sheltered life.  I went to a private school (religious, not rich.   not religious anymore either go figure) and lived 30 minutes away from the nearest, anything.  Closest house was my grandmothers (next door) and after that, a good 15 minute drive before finding another house.   When i got the internet in 1994, it was life changing.  Not only the information, the games (The Games domain / Happy Puppy anyone?), the pr0n, but the social connecting blew my mind.   My first \"Chat Room\" experience was a telnet room.  Commands for everything.  Had to type a ' to send a message.  or specifically type \"Tell user456 That's Cool\"   kinda stuff.   I eventually graduated to IRC, and from there, throughout the rest of my teens and early 20's, that's where i lived.   Didn't have many \"IRL\" friends but didn't care.    Something cool happen? let me go tell the people on the chat!  It wasn't massively over populated, seemed to be just enough people in a room at once.  \n\nBut all that is gone now.   Sure, IRC is still up (i am signed in right now) but the traffic is, abysmal and the conversation, while still having its fleeting moments, is generally nil.   The people who i would at one time considered friends, are gone.   New connections like that, i really don't think can be made.   Partly, because i am in a different point in my life, but partly, peoples attention just isn't there.  To look at a white screen, on a single monitor, browser minimized because loading a webpage with images while trying to chat could lag ya out.  That was true conversation.   Now you can't even have a conversation face to face with someone without them whipping out the phone as to connect to more people at once.  (I'm guilty of it as well, no stones cast)\n\nIt was a simpler time sure, but, it seemed like people wanted to connect.   Now, everybody and there grandma is online, and while yes, i honestly think its a good thing, and its great people can so easily have their space, it does seem a bit, unpersonal anymore.\n\nMaybe I have rose tinted nostalgia glasses on.   Or maybe its all me, and my feelings toward the connections i made online all those years ago are really a personal reflection of how much turmoil my life seems to be now.   Maybe i'm lame but god damnit i still think about some of those interactions Ive had with people who i had never even seen a picture of, let alone can even remember what their name was.\n\nI miss the old internet. \n\nTLDR; Im an old 40 year old man now, and everything sucks.", "I miss good Old Excite Chat rooms.

Today when they were dropped off there was a kid outside with an aide helping him do relaxation exercises while he cried, as the pledge of allegiance sounded over the loudspeakers and classrooms full of kids too young to understand some of the words droned a loyalty oath they can't easily opt out of, to a country that seems to have stopped caring about them the minute they were born. Some of my kid's classmates repeat Alex Jones talking points (which they can't possibly truly understand) about school shootings being fake, while they practice drills in case one happens. We have conversations in the evening about the horrible things some kids say to or about the queer kids, the girls, and the (very few, in my area) racial/ethnic minority kids. The teachers intervene... sometimes, not with much intensity because a minority of parents write angry letters to the superintendent about fears of \"critical race theory\" or \"diversity\" being taught (seriously). \n\nSome of the teachers themselves are apparently reading Qanon sites every evening and telling the kids batshit bullshit during class, and nobody will fire them because (a) the angry minority of parents would cause problems for the administrators and (b) they are having a hard time filling teaching positions. Why is that? Why, the pandemic, of course. The pandemic that has made nearly half of my daughter's life a weird dystopia with masks and no hugging. The pandemic that might realistically have been managed much better by now if we hadn't had four years of active sabotage of public health and effective government followed by two years of milquetoast leadership terrified of making the angry minority angrier. We got yelled at by some bros in a lifted truck in the parking lot of wal-mart the other day, possibly because we had masks on. It was hard to tell what they were screaming, except they were snarling and kind of spitting as they sped away. Great stuff for a kid to experience. Top-notch country we got here.\n\nMy kid is going to grow up in a world with more extreme weather events, more international conflict, more economic booms and crashes, fewer resources, more inter-group violence, and more terrorism because her nation has failed, over and over, to do anything meaningful about climate change. \n\nThey are growing up surveilled a hundred different ways because their nation has no stomach for protecting its citizens from predatory information capitalism. Most of the surveillance comes from the apps they are required to use for school (there is no opt-out) because it's cheaper to use a corporate app with sketchy TOS than to pay more teachers, give them more autonomy, and support more effective education. Schools are starved for funds and teachers are under increasingly strict authoritarian rules about what and how they can teach because the angry minority in this country has made sure public education is underfunded and stuffed with corporate control structures. They'd prefer to just kill public education entirely, but strangling it is the fallback position for now.\n\nMy daughter has cried multiple times when she has read about what has happened (and is still happening) to families and children at our southern border. They barely remember it, but they knew immigrant families when we lived near that border. They become anxious about random things because everything is so anxiety-provoking. We have neighbors with that asshole \"no quarter\" black American flag. My daughter can google so they have figured out that it means our neighbors  probably have several weapons and are ready to murder us if they ever believe that their radical political leaders want them to.\n\nIf they ever have a miscarriage in the wrong state, my daughter can be put in prison, charged with murder. If they use the wrong kind of birth control, same. If they are attracted to women, they will be locked out of marriage. They are already learning that cops do not always help people, and that her POC friends are probably right to fear police and the houses in our neighborhood with that Black vs White \"blue line\" flag on the porch.\n\nThey are old enough to have figured out that SCOTUS is stuffed with people making rules based on a specific religion instead of jurisprudence, and that laws protecting the rights of anyone marginalized in any way are never going to make it past the Senate. They understand that political violence is more likely now than a few years ago, and it will be directed at them and people they love.\n\nMy kid will struggle to have anything remotely like a \"career.\" If they find one, it will probably be choked by corporate micromanagement. More likely, they will go decades cobbling together gig-economy jobs and underemployment without healthcare--because the angry minority doesn't like it--or job security--because the angry minority doesn't like it. They might never be able to afford to buy their own home. \n\nSometimes it's hard to have hope for the future. When I was younger, most of what I wrote here would have seemed unlikely. Surely that would never happen within just 20 years or so. Yeah, I was wrong about that.\n\nI don't necessarily need any response to this. If you think I'm wrong, okay. I get that. If you think these aren't problems, you can probably imagine what I think of your head-in-the-sand attitude, but I also respect the fact that we live in a nation that protects a wide variety of beliefs. If you're just not worried about any of this, I think you should be, whether you have kids or not.\n\n*Edit*: some clarification & typo edits.", ["I guess there\u2019s nothing ordinary people can do, except perhaps move away if they have the means to do so.         \nIt\u2019s not that people aren\u2019t worried it\u2019s that they are powerless.

Representation of women, racial/ethnic minorities, and sexual minorities is massively increasing in business, entertainment, and government.  Global warfare has decreased, and there's not an ever-present threat of thermonuclear war necessitating regular nuclear fallout drills.

I thought there was just more media coverage of these events and maybe more high profile shootings. ", "I disagree partly. In many ways, early social media platforms made it much easier to find out which of the people in your broader community had common interests - for example, facebook would show that you and another friend liked these few same movies and shows, or you were following the same hobby pages. It very quickly evolved in two ways: firstly, advertising took over all content creation and made me unfollow all of my interest pages, and secondly, most people stopped being genuine on these platforms and only used it for value-signalling, meaning that people don\u2019t actually like the pages they follow. So, it used to be good, but not anymore", "So one thing that I didn't see mentioned here but should be at or near the top of the list of criticisms is the fact that social media websites are designed to be addictive in the same way that many other things are. It's one more thing (along with alcohol, drugs, junk food, gambling, etc.) for people with addictive personalities to get sucked into, with the disadvantage that it'll be a while before our society really becomes aware of how serious the issue is.

I like it when I can use technology to make things more efficient and automate tasks. It makes me happy. I'm pretty sure I'd spend all my money on gadgets and tech if I could. Stupid mortgage and car payments.\n\nHaving said all that, I hate social media for all the reasons you said. Social media brings out the worst in people. During the last presidential election I saw friends on facebook who were so close during high school have huge, mean spirited arguments that ended their friendship. I witnessed this several times. It was insane. These people never would have said such awful things to their faces. \n\nI sometimes think about how some people have ideas that are stupid, childish and dangerous. I'm talking about extremists and some conspiracy theorists. There was a time when these people kept their ideas to themselves out of fear of ridicule. Now social media offers these people sanctuaries where like minded people can reinforce their wrong headed ideas and shelter them from facts and truth. It makes me mad. Back in the 1980s when I was young, had you told me that we would someday have all this technology and it would actually make us more ignorant, I wouldn't have believed you. I would have assumed that with so much information available, we'd all become intellectuals who sat around with snifters of brandy discussing enlightened things. \n", "Someone let me know if you AGREE. \nI think maybe the two most toxic things about social media is number one.. The young women who look at people like the Kardashian\u2019s and think to themselves that they need to look like that. They see these people who are portrayed as \u201cbeautiful\u201d but it is barley even a real body. It messes with their mind and they forget that every single woman is beautiful inside and out no matter the shape size or color. You are beautiful who you are and people who have these litterally unobtainable bodies make them feel so insecure about themselves maybe because they don\u2019t have a big ass or tits or clear skin and they forget that they are beautiful as themselves in their own skin. It\u2019s toxic and causes a lot of young women to be insecure, depressed, anxious and just so messed up and it\u2019s such a bad thing. (I\u2019m a man btw)\n\nAnother thing is people who diagnose THEMSELVES with depression or other issues because they might be going through a rough time. Yes, their problems matter too but I think mental health is such an important topic and people who just throw it out there that they are depressed, it takes away from the importance of the people who really are going through depression and suffer from it, and it almost makes their situation seem less serious because so many people say they are but they really aren\u2019t depressed at all. That is toxic and for some people it makes it harder for them to come out and talk about their issues or reach out for help, if they are truly depressed and need professional help. ", "I think it has helped people get perspective on other lives and find out what we all have in common.  People in Russia aren't that different from people in America. People in Syria deserve the same rights as people in Canada.  This wasn't common knowledge before social media. We forget that the Cold War ended at roughly the same time AOL became popular.  Coincidence, yes, but instant global communication among common people had begun for the first time in the history of mankind. \n\nWhile social media has a lot of bad aspects, I also think that the ability to form a global perspective is huge from a humanitarian standpoint, and before social media, common people did not have the tools to communicate on a global scale.       \n\nWe're aren't USING social media effectively in many ways right now, but it is still relatively new,  and in time it will become harder and harder for the world's elite to keep the common people misinformed and divided.  \n\nThe revolution will not be televised, but it will be tweeted (or some evolution thereof), and will only reach the critical mass of people needed to succeed because of social media.  \n\nI think social media is a good thing.

People went online then, but because of the way the platforms (AIM mostly and BBMs) were set up, people primarily still saw one another IRL and only social outcasts were on the internet all the time.

You are all very kind. *Shukran jazeelan.*\n\nLast week, my wife and I travelled to see our adopted Egyptian family, Ali and his wife, his two-year-old daughter, his mother, siblings and cousin. We got back to the UK last night after a week that was overwhelming, wonderful and full of joy and love. This morning I was chatting to Ali on WhatsApp as he was sending me the photos he had taken of our visit.\n\n\nAround six hours ago, Ali suffered a massive heart attack and died at work, aged just 33. We are all broken. I don't know how his family are going to cope and there's nothing I can say or do to help.\n\n\nBelow is a copy post of how we came to know and love the kindest, most loving and generous man one could ever hope to meet. I just wanted you all to know of Ali, and what he meant to those of us who were honoured to have known him. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and please remember him and his family in your heart and prayers.\n\n\nBack when my daughter was 8 years old, an Egyptian family came to our town with their son Ali. The parents were working with and training opthalmic surgeons at our local hospital. Ali spoke no English and was unceremoniously dumped into my daughter's class.\n\n\nIt could have ended very badly but, cutting to the chase, Ali loved his year here in the UK. When his family returned to Egypt at the end of their secondment, he was very upset. Not that we knew about this: his attendance was seen as a nothing more than a minor blip in the school's academic year and, even though he made friends, no-one invited Ali back for tea after school.\n\n\nFast forward 12 years. Ali was now 21, working for a telecoms company and feeling a little homesick for the small English town he visited in the late '90s. He resolved to visit - at Christmas! - and booked his flights and a stay at our local B&B. He also contacted all his old schoolfriends (and their parents!) on Facebook, none of whom remembered him, and so everyone blocked the \"crazy Egyptian scammer\" without a second thought. Everyone that is, apart from my wife. She noticed that Ali knew the teacher's name from his time here, and she vaguely remembered the little Egyptian lad from over a decade before, so she agreed to meet him in one of the town's coffee shops on Christmas Eve. Obviously she dragged all of us along with her, despite our reservations.\n\n\nWhen we met him, Ali had a suitcase filled to the brim with presents for us all, including those friends who hadn't responded to his messages. I asked him what his plans were for the rest of his trip. He had none: he was going to spend Christmas alone in his B&B room, and was hoping to visit London  the train to do some shopping. Fundamentally, he was all on his own. So obviously we dragged him back to our place, made him stay with us instead of the B&B, took him shopping and sightseeing to London, and then drove him to Heathrow when it was time for him to return to Egypt.\n\n\nHe stayed with us again at Christmas a few years later when he was suffering from depression and major health problems. We looked after him and quickly grew to love this shy, naive and courageous young man with a huge heart. He also came over to attend our children's weddings so, when he was due to marry, he in turn invited us to the ceremony and we gladly accepted. Me, my wife and my youngest travelled to Egypt to see Ali marry nearly 3 years ago now. We met his family who welcomed us with warmth and generosity, giving us one of the most amazing experiences of our lives. We had finally become his English family as Ali, his mum, his siblings and other relatives were now our Egyptian family.\n\n\nRecently his wife gave birth to a little girl. We are visiting them all again later this year and I cannot wait. May I end by saying you will never meet a people who are kinder, more generous, open-hearted and proud of showing their emotions, than the Egyptian people.", ["Oh no, how sad!

I commented and another person said something that I took as criticism of my actions, but they probably didn't mean it that way. I had mentioned my mother was aggressive, angry and upset, and their response was \"you would probably be aggressive, angry and upset if someone took away your freedom and locked you up with no chance at escape\".  \n\nI did take offense at that, because it was my brothers and I who arranged for her to be placed into a Memory Care Facility. After much reflection on the situation, I feel I have to say I didn't take away her freedoms. \n\nShe talks about going home, but she is waiting for her mom and dad to pick her up so she can go home.  Her dad died in 1962, her mother around 1996. She believes she is at school, and we assume what school she is talking about is nurses training when she lived in a dorm, which would be around 1945-47 when she was a student. She often refers to going to seeing the babies, but its not her children but the children of her sister, who had children back in 1947. \n\nShe doesn't talk about the home she lived in just prior to being placed in a home, as she doesn't remember that house. If we mention the address, she doesn't remember it, and if we take her by and show it to her, there is no recognition. She remembers her parents home of her childhood and can describe it, yet it was torn down long ago.  In some way, the fact that she doesn't remember her recent home makes us feel better that we had to sell it for her living expenses. \n\nIn summary, it feels good to talk about this journey into my mother's dementia. Her mental decline has progressed rapidly over the past 7-8 months, and taken us by surprise. Names are gone, best way I can describe it is we took a picture of the family for her 95 birthday, and I spent 45 minutes pointing out who was in the picture, which would be forgotten by the time we went through all the people one time. It's not difficult going to see her, only to realize she doesn't remember my name.  \n\nThe best way to describe it is, she know I'm someone she loves. \nStill love my mother, it's just we never expected to be at this point.", ["Until someone is a caregiver they can not understand what it is like.

We're all trying to muddle through as best we can.

At first we tried what we could to keep him at home for as long as possible but it wasn't enough towards the end and he was far safer and better cared for in a skilled nursing facility with lots of staff to share the work.\n\nTake good care of yourself during this hard time. you have done the best thing for your mother. Also, don't ever take offense when ignorant people say ignorant things. it's a shame that they do but it shouldn't alter your state of mind one bit. it's a mistake to give random people that kind of power over your state of mind because it is a precarious way to live - especially these days.", "One of my Grandmas had to be put in a home because of Alzheimer\u2019s. We tried keeping her but holy shit. By the time grandpa died she had gone pretty far without a diagnosis. And then it all went further downhill. Fast.\n\nShe was in our house for a while after grandpa passed. She tried to escape several times (to go to her childhood home), she had to be told to eat, she needed to be constantly watched, and she was going between memories so quickly. One minute she\u2019s angry at me because we didn\u2019t go to school, the next she\u2019s telling me how much she likes the slippers she has. Me and my mom taking care of her (while I was off and my mom had to go to work still) for a few days felt like months of living in an insane asylum. And my dad couldn\u2019t handle it at all (his mom) so it left us a person short. \n\nSo, really, anyone can go off about how sad it is to be left in a nursing home (and it is), but if they ever actually take care of someone with dementia they\u2019ll shut the fuck up real quick.", "Went through this with my mom.

Take care of yourself.", "People  who haven't experienced the changes in a person from dementia have no clue what they're talking about. They think of dementia as someone being in a bad mood or being scattered or forgetful -- but actually, it's 100% worse, because for patients with dementia, their brain is flat-out dying bit by bit, and \"moods\" or attentiveness have nothing to do with their condition. Those who suffer from dementia are cognitively disabled (so much so that they usually don't even realize they're impaired), and part of this harsh reality is that they will never get better; they will only get worse. It's a progressive, terminal condition, something impossible for most people to understand and harder to accept. ... But it's not our job to respond to every comment or piece of misguided advice. It takes our focus off the patient, distracting us from adapting.\n\nFind supportive friends who know what dementia is all about. Try to ignore the insensitive advice and comments from outsiders, because it's hard enough dealing with dementia -- instead, focus on your loved one and finding the right care for them. You don't need to respond to everyone or justify your family's choices for care.", "My great grandmother was so distressed that she couldn't find her babies.  My grandmother thought her son was her brother.  My grandfather always knew who everyone was, but couldn't remember anything that happened in the last 5 minutes.

She grew up in this house. She married and moved out but our family visited my grandparents here almost every week.\n\nDecades later, my grandfather died. And then my grandmother died. My mother bought their house from the estate. Soon after, my father died and my mother moved back into her childhood home. She's been living here again for more than 25 years.\n\nI moved in here with her about 4 years ago when it became clear she could no longer fully care for herself because of her dementia.\n\nSo why is she frequently aggressive, angry, and upset? Because she believes this isn't her home. She keeps insisting her real home is somewhere else.\n\nShe keeps trying to leave the house to find her real home. Four times during the last summer she escaped but the neighbors spotted her quickly and brought her home. Twice during the chilly fall. One of those times was at night and I had to call the police to help find her.\n\nSome days she just sleeps a lot. And then other days she spends hours screaming and swearing at me because she thinks she has babies waiting for her at her real home and I'm keeping her from them. Days when she keeps insisting that this is absolutely not her house and I'm just a nasty hateful liar who is keeping her prisoner.\n\nYes I keep the doors locked so she can't escape. Yes I'm taking away her freedom.\n \nIt's to keep her safe. Her anger at being kept here at home isn't based in reality.\n\nSo I absolutely understand that you made the choice to give your mother the environment that is best for her and you did it because you care for her.

In many states people with dementia/Alzheimers patients are legally incapable of consenting to anything or signing any legal documents.\n\nA great uncle had dementia & was in a facility where he was safe. All the little old ladies would \"visit\" him. Well the staff caught the one of the ladies with the uncle having whatever their version of sex was & then the aunt & uncle had to get several full time aides to watch him in the facility 24/7/365 because the facility said that dementia patients can't have sex because they can't legally consent because they're not in their right minds.\n\nThey eventually had to place him elsewhere (for the obvious reason but for other reasons too) but before he left the aides said it was the little old ladies that would be coming by to see the great uncle & coming on to him & not the other way around. The aides were always shooing them away daily but *HE* was perceived to be the aggressor I guess just because he was male.\n\nThis was also a man who pre-dementia wasn't that type of person. He would shake your hand when he met you & that was it. He wasn't a lovey dovey type or a hugger either.

I don't know what day it is.\" She was really scared and it was profoundly heartbreaking for me to hear her say this.

She called the police on my sister because my sister had a new born baby that my mum was convinced she'd stolen.\n\nThe hardest part was the impact it had on my father, my mum was very hard on him, he was 10 years older and had to be on watch 24/7.  In the end her diabetes wasnt managed well and he was struggling with her so she ended up in a nursing home.\n\nIt somewhat slowed her decline but really hit my father, he felt useless and a bit of a burden and unable to help.  He sat in the house and then pandemic hit and he didnt do anything for two years... just declining.  He died two weeks ago, i'd put it down to a broken heart.\n\nPersonally it has really hit my mental health, i have been on happy pills for a while and i've had to stop going to visit her, it wasnt doing anything for her but it was just crushing me more than i could bear.  Of course I feel terribly guilty, I go occasionally but not as frequently as others in my family.  \n\nIt feels like with my dad, it was a band-aid being ripped off and it was heart wrenching.  With my mum it feels like its being ripped off every time I see her, then a new one applied and it just keeps getting ripped off.. utterly horrible.\n\nMy mum is well cared for, loved by the staff who we have a great relationship with.

Any attempt to help or remind her was met with fury and screaming. And running away. We tried bringing in home health care and that was a complete failure - again - fury and screaming. \n\nNow she's calm, is eating well, is taking her medications, and she's not in her paranoid, fearful world. Does she want to stay there? Nope. But the kicker about this disease is that rationality and explanations aren't relevant. The person who suffers from it can't be reasoned with because they're in a different place - their own reality. It's crushing to see my mother this way, and to see my father ache for her to \"get better\". But having her at home almost killed both of them. \n\nAnd you're right - she knows she's loved. That is the important thing.", "Thank you for sharing.  My mom had a stroke in November of 2020 which brought about her dementia. She slowly went away, going from the sweet caring individual she was her entire life to a sometimes violent and hateful individual.

She had her moments where she was her old self but mostly my mom went away with the stroke. My mom was a huge baseball fan and especially the Atlanta Braves. One of the last things she vividly remembers and could talk about was them winning the World Series. I am so happy that she saw it and enjoyed that in her last months on earth. \n\nMy mom had afib and had to be on two different blood thinners to keep her from having another stroke. She died on February 1, after falling in her house nearly two weeks earlier. She never quit but fought to the very end.

There\u2019s fidget blankets, painting, folding clothes, sewing buttons etc. we had a lady who enjoyed gathering bed linens and bringing them to us. We then made the beds and she smoothed the covers down. As a person who routinely tried to get out this was a great stimulation for her. \n\n4. Give a list of your loved ones favourites to staff. We can use these to help calm them when agitated. Favourite candy, song, drink, etc. \n\n5. If they had a routine they have done their entire life (such as bedtime prayers) give that info to the staff. We try to prevent the agitation when possible but if we don\u2019t know these little routines that\u2019s hard to do. \n\n7. We used pictures a lot vs words to communicate. Loved one might not remember the word for hungry today but if I show a picture of a sandwich they are more likely to respond to the picture. Look up Pecs, we made our own for what we needed. \n\n8. Gestures are important. If you want them to sit somewhere so the nurse can do their blood pressure. Pat the chair, sit beside them, maybe have the nurse show on you first. \n\nRemember that when talking to someone with dementia, it\u2019s like someone speaking a different language that you know a few words of but they are going to fast to understand what they are saying.", "It's super easy for people not giving the care to be assholes and be super critical of the people actually doing the work.

Each image was about 20 inches tall.  It took almost 3 minutes to print a full image.\n\nThe paper was wet, and slightly salty.  (That was the electrolyte.)  \n\nThe printer had two blades built into it.  One on each side of the paper.  The inner blade was wrapped helically around a drum.  The outer blade was a large band that was slowly rotated in order to reduce wear.\n\nOne section of the outer blade went straight across the front of the paper, and the drum rotated quickly so that the inner blade had only a single point in \"contact\" with the outer blade.  I say \"contact\" because there was a wet and salty sheet of paper between the two blades.\n\nAccording to an electrical signal that corresponded with the received weather data, the blade on the drum would send an arc of electricity through the paper to the front blade.  This would \"burn\" the paper, which created a burned-in pixel on the paper.\n\nIn this fashion, the weather fax image was actually burned into the paper, one scan line at a time.  An image was usually 800 scan lines.\n\nAs you might imagine, this machine required constant maintenance.  It was a piece of electronics that contained salty water as a necessary part of its function.  We were always performing corrosion control on this thing!  It didn't help that the blades shaved a fine dust of salty paper and dribbled that dust deep into the electronics.\n\nWe also had to keep the blades sharp.  Dull blades wouldn't arc the spark in a manner that burned the paper.  So there was the hazard of possibly being cut by salty, rusty equipment during maintenance.\n\nAnd if a blade developed a \"snag\" it would suddenly turn into a paper shredder, and maintenance would get a call!\n\nThe Air Force used these printers because they were \"Wide Format\", which allowed them to have large weather maps that they could pin to the walls.  These days, they use other sorts of printers.\n\nThe WEFAX satellite signal is still being broadcast, and with the right equipment you can decode it and look at up-to-date weather maps for your area.

Yes, that was caused by bad bundles of NINJA and LIAR loans, but the idea behind it was sound: Income from mortgages is reliable and long-term.  The problem was that you didn't know who owned those assets, and those NINJAs and LIARS screwed you as an investor. \n\nIn 2009 I thought banks would turn around and start leasing these buildings as they reclaimed mortgages, it only made sense to me.  The bank wholly owned it and a lot of the properties weren't subject to most of the difficulties of Foreclosed homes because of the sudden, sharp dip. The forum I was part of at the time thought I was crazy, Banks weren't interested in this. \n\nTurns out I was right on the idea, wrong on the players. It just happened to be the investors, not the banks themselves who wound-up buying and renting-out properties. They took the opportunity of all these unowned/ abandoned properties and turned them into investments.

The profit to be made from that larger home was significantly more. \n\nNow add-on that these large rental companies are paying cash and buying up properties faster than you can build.

The ideal situation for me came when I was in my 40s, so I took it, but I sure as hell wasn't going to buy a house just to be able to say, \"Look! I bought a house!\"\n\nOnce you buy, you're responsible for every damn thing, from the fridge and water heater to entire electrical and plumbing systems. I had a broken pipe under the bathroom floor that required a plumber to take a jackhammer to the floor. Then of course, I had to replace the floor. My a/c, which was new enough to still be under extended warranty when I bought the house, crapped out when the warranty expired (because of course it did), and the \"band-aid\" fix would've been about $500. The long term fix was $12K for a new HVAC system, and since I plan to be here until I can't live independently any more, I'm now making a payment on that in addition to my mortgage.\n\nSome people buy a big house because they have kids, only to have to figure out how to clean and maintain that much house once the kids are grown and gone, or sell in a different market than the one they bought in. Some people buy and then have to move for a job, and maybe the market is good, but maybe it's not. Am I the only person who remembers how many people ended up underwater on their mortgages in 2008? Just wait until the boomers start dying or moving into care homes. It's very likely we'll see a glut of housing on the market once the biggest generation starts selling, and it will bring prices down.\n\nIn sum, if you don't have a high degree of confidence that the property you're buying is one you'll live in until you die or at least until you've paid off the mortgage, it's a crap shoot. The amount of interest one pays over the course of a mortgage can easily outstrip the value of the house at the time of sale, especially when you add in all the maintenance you put in over that time period. Neighborhoods rise and drop in value all the time. Maybe you'll get lucky, but maybe you won't.

But I took the leap and bought it, which turned out to be the most important decision of my life, because now all the houses in my area are valued at 400-500k. If I aspired to purchase a home now in 2021 in my neighborhood, on a single income, it would NEVER happen. I could never afford a down payment by myself on a half-mil.

It's no wonder \"middle class\" has become the new \"just above poverty line\" class.\nFor my family: In order for us to save up the down payment to buy our starter home, we had to stretch our finances immensely thin for years. We went without many \"luxuries\" like yearly check ups for example. We shopped at thrift stores only. We barely scraped the money together. We do a little better than living paycheck to paycheck, but barely. The dream is absolutely drying up. It's so hard to find a home worth buying that is within budget, even harder if you have kids and have to worry about school zones. For us, we had to buy a home in an area where to be honest the schools aren't great or even good. We're hopeful that by the time our children reach high school we can save enough to relocate to a town with better access to education and better quality schools. Finding a home in a town with a decent school system was impossible though: not only were the homes incredibly overpriced, but they would be on and off the market in a week, max (and that's being very generous). There just isn't enough housing to match the demand of growing families and of adults in the US.", "I live in a low cost of living area so it's still possible, but I still don't know how \"normal\" people do it.  I'm a Xennial (between gen-X and millennial) and had a lot of economy-driven setbacks early in my career, plus I had to bootstrap myself out of family poverty.  I eventually got a degree in a good field, but only just now started earning what historically other people in my position would have been earning much earlier in their careers.\n\nMy first wife and I did buy a house in 2009 taking advantage of the homebuyer tax credit.  At the time I was thinking the country was headed for a situation where it might be difficult for a first-time homebuyer to get in if we waited too long.  Banks were foreclosing on everyone, prices were falling and we were seeing them snapped up by all-cash investors and fewer proportion of individual families owning houses.  I thought, these are all going to be turned into rental properties and prices will rebound on the remaining homes.\n\nI feel like I correctly foresaw the general direction things were headed that we've arrived by 2020/2021, but I radically underestimated how long it would take to get there (I thought it would come ten years sooner than it did).  Ironically during that time my first wife and I tried to trade up from that starter house and it *failed to sell*.  (A developer opened up a neighborhood of new houses near ours with same price and sq ft.  Plus the realtor we hired convinced us we should list the house for $1000 under X, but inexplicably listed it for a different price, $1000 *over* X.)\n\nAfter I got divorced I left my ex- with the house; it was in her name anyway.  I didn't imagine it would take as long as it did for me to be in a position to buy another.  I remarried, and my second wife felt her student loans precluded any thought of buying a house.  Nevertheless we were able to save up some, but at the end of 2019 we started seeing houses flying off the market like toilet paper in a pandemic.  One I really wanted, that was in the neighborhood where we rent, went under contract faster than we could go from seeing the for sale sign go up to calling the number.\n\nSo we decided we'd be renting for the foreseeable future, and I switched my focus from saving to investing, because we weren't going to need the money for a down payment it seems.  If I couldn't buy real estate, maybe I could buy mutual funds instead.  Then a funny thing happened - my mother in law's neighbor mentioned he's going to sell his house and asked my wife if we knew anyone who might want to buy it.  My wife took her index finger in a big circle and pointed back at herself, \"uh, me!\"\n\nSo I guess now we're \"part of the problem\" from the perspective of others trying to buy in this market, because we got to put a house under contract before it even got listed.  (Really it's just a blessing that we got this opportunity.)  I sold my recently-purchased mutual funds just in case we needed extra money for closing, and THEN we found out I qualify for a VA loan after all - which doesn't require money down.  (I'd previously been uncertain if I qualified, and the VA website wasn't working for me to print out my certificate of eligibility.  The lender was able to get it for me.)\n\nTo bring this back around to the original poster's points, the seller of this house, who is himself a realtor, mentioned that they just aren't making \"starter house\" sized homes like this one anymore.  In fact it's a little smaller than the house we're currently renting, which is the only downside, but with more control by owning the property I can do things to make better use of the space that is there.  We're paying a price per square foot that would have been \"overpaying\" just a few years ago, but when all the houses are going for that much it's just \"the price.\"", "It's a pretty sweet deal for people with mortgages now.  First with the forebarence going on they have until end of August to just not make any payments -- no penalty or impact on credit, nothing like that.  New Biden housing plan is allowing for restructuring loans to be an additional 40 years with no penalty.   That's an insane amount of time to pay off the house over (if you wanted to drag it out that long)", "I think this depends a lot on timing and geography. I'm 50+ and basically all of my HS/college friends own homes, many of them in expensive cities. In some cases they bought in before the markets blew up (like Seattle and Portland in the mid-1990s, for example) and in others they ended up in $$$ careers. But the majority just live in more modest locations. \n\nNow if you're talking about Millennials then yes, they are screwed. If you didn't have a house 5+ years ago (and ideally 15+) it's going to be damned tough now, unless/until the market crashes. I assume there will be a lot of empty McMansions once the Boomers die off, because nobody I know wants to live in a 7BR/6BA crapbox next to a freeway...those will probably be pretty cheap in ten years or so.", "Do you have a job that can easily telecommute? Now seems like the time to start moving to areas that are inexpensive now because of distance from city centers but will start booming with everyone telecommuting.", "Basically the same starting stats as you, but I did buy a home and am currently paying it off. I probably could have bought a house sooner, but I decided living in NYC for a little while was a good idea for some reason. I decided in the early 2000's that homeownership was important to me, and that it wasn't going to be a thing that was going to happen if I stayed in the NYC area.  So I packed up and moved to San Antonio, Texas. Even Texas was going through the bubble at that point, but I was lucky and caught it at the tail-end. If I had waited another year or two, I could have bought for much less than I did (or upgraded). Honestly, I wish I had done that, but I didn't want to relo from hotel to apartment to house over multiple years - I wanted to be done moving around.\n\nThe good parts about homeownership - I don't have to worry about rent getting jacked sky-high when the next renewal came due (grew up in apartments, so I know how much my parents dreaded this). I have a big giant bundle of collateral - if shit goes completely south as far as job/savings goes, I can currently sell my house and make enough to live off of for a year or more. It's nice to know that (again, barring any horrible mishaps), I'll have a place to call home. \n\nThe bad parts - I feel very locked down where I am. Apartments were very mobile - if I wanted to get my gear and move to another state for a year, all you had to do was say, \"No thank you!\" when it was time to renew your lease. Selling a home is a bit more involved. All the stuff you can call the maintenance crew for, you're responsible for yourself. I have replaced multiple toilets, water heaters, and softeners. These were not skills that I really wanted on my personal experience resume. Your like or dislike of your home will be very dependent on things generally outside of your control - new construction, **neighbors**, traffic, internet providers, *neighbors*, trash schedules, etc... These are just some of the things that pop into my top of mind.\n\nIf I had to do it all over again, I would go the route of owning/buying another home. I think I do prefer the permanence of a single living location, rather than having to deal with moving on a potentially yearly basis. Even with all the toilets.  Also keep in mind that housing in the *hot areas* has always been expensive. The reason our parents were able to get the homes that they did was because they generally had to look at homes in the boondocks in these weird things called 'suburbs'. The big cities are turning into sprawls - the best 'bargains' are going to be found on what we'd consider the outskirts right now. A lot of folks with great homes waited for the city to come to them.\n\nThis is going to sound horrible, but the housing market is going to correct itself again, probably within the next few years. I don't know if it'll be as big as the one we saw in 2008/2009, but if you're even considering buying a home, you should be saving right now in preparation for this correction.

There you're still below your quota.\n> \n> You don't love yourself enough. Or you'd love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they're really possessed by what they do, they'd rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts.\n> \n> Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?\n> \n> \n\nMarcus not withstanding, perhaps I'd still mix in that UK adage and say that what you might need at this point isn't no job but a change.

I'm so sorry for the losses you're suffering, both that of losing your mom and the pain of regret you feel. But, Honey, here's something you probably haven't thought of yet. You gave your mother the best moments of her life. Holding and snuggling baby you, seeing your first smile, laughing that first goofy baby belly laugh with you! Your first steps into her open arms, your first words, your sweet toddler cheeks and sturdy little legs! As you grew she watched and helped and felt that warm pride and love over and over and over again. \n\n*Those* are the memories an old mother cherishes and keeps close to her heart. When children grow into adulthood, parents have to learn to let go- and we do. We learn that there was never a guarantee that, as adults, we'd necessarily always be great friends. Life just doesn't always work that way. But she knew *the first you* better than anyone else, she had the best years of your life pretty much all to herself. And that's more than enough, my dear. You gave your mother far, far more than you will ever know. You were her golden child when it meant the most.

Almost 10 years ago my father was in a motorcycle wreck without a helmet. He was taken on a helicopter to the nearest hospital and we were told to come to say goodbye. He was in a medically induced coma for three months following that and suffered some long-term injuries, but still somehow survived.\n\nWhen he woke up and was able to talk, he told me he didn't remember anything before the wreck for a few weeks but he did remember lying in the field, feeling what he believed was his last breath, and that the only thing going through his mind was that his kids (me and my brother) would be okay. He said there was just a warmth that washed over him and \"it was better than the feeling I've had from any drugs before\".\n\nOne would think that he'd have thought about all the wasted time spent not being in our lives (which was a thing for a good number of years) or regrets about his life/the way he spent it. Instead, in what was very close to being the end, he felt like he raised good kids into good adults and let it go.\n\nThat's always made me feel somewhat more at ease with the thought about my own death and the whole mystery of it all.

What he'll remember is my lifetime of being his daughter. All the good memories I had and all the times I showed him I cherished him and loved him. The little things. From me saying good night. To me signing emails with \"I love you\" to the cards I made him on his birthdays and during Father's Days. \n\n\n\nThe fact that you tried to help her and your little brother find a home is what happened. That action of yours was the reality, and she'll remember that. Even if she tries to downplay what you did - the fact of the matter is you did help. And deep down inside, she knew that at some point. So she can't villainize you. \n\n\nShe raised you. i'm sure there are many times when, as a toddler, or as a teenager, you were upset at her when you were in the wrong. Doesn't diminish the bond between you guys. And as the adult in that situation, she probably understood that you were just upset at the time. Heck, some of us as teenagers have probably told our parents in a fit of rage, \"I hate you!\" which may have stung them for a little while. But I think most parents know it's just our emotions getting the better of us, and that we don't actually hate them. The proof is in the millions of actions and words that transpired since then. \n\n\nI think that she knew you cared for her. You tried to help.

Now it's the lefties.", "Confusing moral code with purity code and more importantly, positive freedoms with negative freedoms.", "Narcisism", "I\u2019m going to give the complicated answer, instead of the shallow answer I first thought to provide. \n\nFirst, I think the people to whom you are referring are radicals. They are radical anti-liberals, rather than conservatives. They actually have more in common with the original conservatives who tried to turn back the French Revolution and return to the era of nobility. However, I think it is fair to say that today, the word \u201cconservative\u201d means someone who is averse to radical change. \n\nI actually believe that most people are conservatives. Most people are averse to radical change because we are hardwired to avoid risk. We are blessed as a species to have progressive visionaries to help humanity evolve for the better. Though, it is probably for the best that they are seldom in charge of anything.\n\nThe radicals whom you are describing aren\u2019t conservatives because they don\u2019t wish to preserve the present order. They wish to regress substantially. A conservative today would support our modest welfare state; they would tolerate the established preference for egalitarianism and meritocracy; and they would forcefully defend liberalism. Those are things that have been around long enough to constitute the status quo. There are plenty of conservatives who are like this. Arguably, the pre-Trump era Republican Party was still conservative however vanishingly so. \n\nIn every era, there have been right-wing radicals who have tried to pull the nation backwards. Things get confusing because in a democracy, any radical group that wants to be successful knows they must imbed themselves within the center through obfuscation and subterfuge. Otherwise, the majority would reject them outright. \n\nRadical right-wing groups have achieved this to different degrees of success throughout American history. The outbreak of the Civil War was a high point for white supremacist radicals. The Franklin Roosevelt Administration was a low point in large part because of the United States\u2019 fight against fascism in WWII. The 1990s were actually a low point because several acts of white nationalist domestic terrorism alienated people. Today is a high-point for far-right radicals. They have been enabled by social media. All radicals are enabled by social media at the expense of the \u201cexhausted majority.\u201d Far-right radicals have effectively taken over the Republican Party. They purged and silenced the actual conservatives by weaponizing the attention economy and through simple threats of violence. \n\nSecond, I believe what you are frustrated by in your post is the inconsistency with which the political right packages it\u2019s ideals. To be successful in democratic politics, politicians know they need to embrace national narratives. The American national mythology has long been defined by liberalism\u2014free exercise, free speech, free press, free enterprise, equal protection under the law, and democracy. Any successful political movement has had to frame their ideology within the context of that narrative. (It\u2019s worked out great for progressives who have used these narratives to expand rights to all Americans regardless of race, sex, religion, or identity otherwise.)\n\nConservatives of the past did certainly oppose the Civil Rights movement, and they framed this quite often as being about \u201cstates rights\u201d and \u201csmall government.\u201d This worked conveniently well because the majority of American society also opposed the Civil Rights movement, so the real challenge came from a federal government that could force the state governments and individuals to comply with the constitutional guarantees for all Americans. \n\n\u201cStates rights\u201d and \u201csmall government\u201d was never about the importance of federalism or individual liberty. It was about certain states resisting the federal government\u2019s ability to enforce the constitution regardless of the popular will or the makeup of state government. It was about maintaining poll taxes. It was about preserving public school racial segregation. It was about retaining sexist laws and institutions. It was about protecting individual wealth from the welfare state.\n\nNow the dominant culture tends to be more secular, embraces feminism, considers racism the ultimate evil, and is quickly moving from tolerance to acceptance of LGBTQ folks. Radicals on the far-right recognize that they can\u2019t convince people to observe their arcane  morality, so they need the government to do the work of reshaping America. Nevertheless, they still have to work with the same American mythology rhetoric. \n\nTheir rhetoric has changed. They frame outlawing abortion as protecting the rights of the fetus. They frame the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay bills\u201d as protecting parents rights to raise their children as they see fit. They frame voting restrictions as protecting the integrity of democratic elections. The don\u2019t attack the press\u2019s right to report; they undermine its legitimacy. They support \u201creligious freedom,\u201d when they allow Christian groups to violate the law. Everything they do is packaged in liberal wrapping paper. \n\nThis is why there is so much confusion and inconsistency. The conservative party is now captured by anti-liberalism radicals. A lot of conservatives do not subscribe to the far-right ideology and still believe in conservative principles of the past. A lot of them won\u2019t admit that they have lost their party. Therefore, you have many different discordant voices coming from the Republican Party. \n\nFurthermore, for the conservatives of the past and far-right radicals of today, their ideology is not consistent with core American ideals about liberty and democracy. If they were open about their views, they could not be electorally successful.", "To the christian fundamentalist \"freedom\" does not mean the ability to do what you want to do, it means being \"free\" from sin and temptation.

People with dementia seem to function better in the mornings. 3. Consider bringing another friend with you when you visit. This will take part of the burden off you to think of something to say when there is a lapse in the conversation. And having a sympathetic friend to talk to will help you process your own feelings about the situation. 4. Try to give your friend a change of scenery. (I assume she's in a nursing home.)

We all lived on the same street, next door to each other. We had to cross a busy street, and as a shortcut, would traipse alongside a small bayou that ran across the street from where we lived. Thing about that was we would sometimes encounter a grabby vagrant that sometimes set up camp under the bridge. Our moms didn't work, but never really bugged us about our whereabouts after school. We would dump our satchels on the couch, grab a snack and watch Thundercats or He-Man, then run back out and play till our dads came home from work. Dinner, then homework, then baths. There was a sort of reasonless excitement at the sight of one's home as we emerged from the leafy tunnel by the bayou. You knew mom was inside, ready to give you hugs and kisses. And there was always something tasty for a snack... whether it was a piping hot, rolled up, freshly made flour tortilla with queso fresco or sliced jicama with lime, mom always had a yummy snack waiting for us. It's this memory that makes me sad for my own kids, who get home hours before I do and fend for themselves till I get home. What's worse is that oftentimes I'm drained from all the chattering at work, conference calls and meetings, chit chat with co-workers, that by the time I get home all I want is peace and quiet and hate that I'm sometimes abrupt with my kids when they try to tell me about their day. I *know* this and so I am able to squelch the urge to scream but it takes its toll.

We probably had the dirtiest mouths two 6th grade girls could have.\n-\tWhen one of us (probably her) got Super Mario Bros 3, we played pretty much nonstop. When her mom got home from work we\u2019d stop playing, leave the Nintendo on and change the channel on the TV. Then I\u2019d come over the next day and we\u2019d pick up where we left off.

But no, instead the addition caused a small explosion! For some reason my dad had stored some gasoline in an open plastic cup. He took that secret to the grave I guess.

Most did, unless they lived far enough out to take the school bus.

I was still close enough to school to walk home, even though I was supposed to ride the bus. If the weather was nice, I would usually walk home. I didn't get to goof off much, though. Because my mother was working, she would have a list of chores for me to do. I had to do stuff like wash dishes, vacuum, wash clothes, etc. I didn't mind doing them too much, because my mom was always tired when she got home from work, and I wanted to help her out. I hated the divorce and separation, but one thing that I liked was that it was the first time I had ever had cable TV, because it was included with the apartment.\n\nI think it really helped me as I got older.

They told the neighbors where they were going, left us a bit of cash and told us to be good, and went to France for 10 days. \n\nWe got ourselves up in the morning, went to school, came home, had our canned spaghetti and did our homework while we watched TV.

The exhaustion of jet lag is far greater than an early-morning or late-night video call with a client or employee in a different time zone. Also, the carbon footprint of a video call is far lower than that of an airline trip. Since covid, video calls have replaced a lot of business trips. Fine by me!\n\n- I don't have kids because that would kinda mess up all of the above, and also I think the best way to reduce our species's carbon footprint is to have fewer children.\n\nI do miss meeting friends for dinner or coffee, and I miss going out of town for vacation.

Either people post the least reputable shit and it goes off, or people post stuff from reputable sources and the comments add nothing seemingly. \n\nSo at this point I'm wondering what reddits purpose is for me anymore.

There are just going to be more and more people infected, and more and more deaths. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s actions over the past week stand in stark contrast to those of the United States. In the wake of a new cluster of more than 150 new cases that emerged in Beijing, authorities sealed off neighborhoods, launched a mass testing campaign and imposed travel restrictions.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump maintains that the United States will not shut down a second time, although a surge in cases has persuaded governors in some states, including Arizona, to back off their opposition to mandatory face coverings in public.\n\nCommentators and experts in Europe, where cases have continued to decline, voiced concerns over the state of the U.S. response. A headline on the website of Germany\u2019s public broadcaster read: \u201cHas the U.S. given up its fight against coronavirus?\u201d Switzerland\u2019s conservative Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung newspaper concluded, \u201cU.S. increasingly accepts rising covid-19 numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing one can say with certainty: There\u2019s nothing surprising about this development,\u201d a journalist wrote in the paper, referring to crowded U.S. beaches and pools during Memorial Day weekend in May.\n\nSome European health experts fear that the rising U.S. caseloads are rooted in a White House response that has at times deviated from the conclusions of leading scientists.\n\n\u201cMany scientists appeared to have reached an adequate assessment of the situation early on [in the United States], but this didn\u2019t translate into a political action plan,\u201d said Thomas Gerlinger, a professor of health sciences at the University of Bielefeld in Germany. For instance, it took a long time for the United States to ramp up testing capacity.\n\nWhereas the U.S. response to the crisis has at times appeared disconnected from American scientists\u2019 publicly available findings, U.S. researchers\u2019 conclusions informed the actions of foreign governments.\n\nLauterbach cited in particular the work of Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, whose research with colleagues recently said that forms of social distancing may have to remain in place into 2022. Lipsitch\u2019s work, Lauterbach said, helped him to convince German Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz that the pandemic will be \u201cthe new normal\u201d for the time being, and it impacted German officials\u2019 thinking on how long their strategy should be in place.\n\nRegarding the effectiveness of face masks, Lauterbach added, \u201cwe almost entirely relied on U.S. studies.\u201d Germany was among the first major European countries to make face masks mandatory on public transport and in supermarkets.\n\nLipsitch said Thursday that he was not previously aware of the impact of his research on German decision-making, but he added that he has spoken to representatives of several other foreign governments in recent weeks, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and officials or advisers from Canada, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nEven though Lipsitch cautioned it was impossible for him to say how or if his conversations influenced foreign governments\u2019 thinking, he credited the overall European response as \u201cscience-based and a sincere effort to find out what experts in the field believe is a range of possible scenarios and consequences of decisions.\u201d\n\nLipsitch said he presented some of his research to a White House group in the early stages of the U.S. outbreak but said the Trump administration\u2019s response to the pandemic did not reflect his conclusions. \u201cI think they have cherry-picked models that at each point looked the most rosy, and fundamentally not engaged with the magnitude of the problem,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House has defended its approach as science-based. After a study released in March by Imperial College London predicted 510,000 deaths in Britain and 2.2 million in the United States if the pandemic remained fully uncontrolled, for instance, the Trump administration indicated that it was taking the research into account.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t act quickly and smartly, we would have had, in my opinion and in the opinion of others, anywhere from 10 to 20 and maybe even 25 times the number of deaths,\u201d Trump said two months later.\n\nBut European researchers dispute that the U.S. government\u2019s reliance on scientists to inform decision-making comes anywhere near the degree to which many European policymakers have relied on researchers.\n\nAfter consulting U.S. research and German studies, for instance, German leaders agreed to make reopening dependent on case numbers, meaning restrictions snap back or reopening gets put on hold if the case numbers in a given region exceed a certain threshold.\n\nMeanwhile, several U.S. states have reopened despite rising case numbers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand that logic,\u201d said Reinhard Busse, a health-care management professor at the Technical University of Berlin.\n\nLauterbach said that even though most Germans disapproved of Trump before the pandemic, even his staunchest critics in Germany were surprised by how even respected U.S. institutions, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, struggled to respond to the crisis.\n\nThe CDC, for instance, initially botched the rollout of test kits in the early stages of the outbreak.\n\n\u201cLike many other aspects of our country, the CDC\u2019s ability to function well is being severely handicapped by the interference coming from the White House,\u201d said Harvard epidemiologist Lipsitch. \u201cAll of us in public health very much hope that this is not a permanent condition of the CDC.\u201d\n\nSome observers fear the damage will be difficult to reverse. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought of the CDC as a reliable and trusted source of information,\u201d said Wiles, the New Zealand specialist. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d\n\n---", "I would just like to point out that the US has had almost no guidance on the Federal level with this. We essentially have no leadership and really haven't for the last 3 years.\n\nThe only leadership we do have hasn't explicitly told us to wear masks.

That sucks, because back in the day (like 20 years ago), we were all friends because of common interests and such, but now that cannot be.\n\nI had a work friend recently who I had to distance myself from because of his overzealous right-winged-ness. Super great ally at work, had my back and worked hard to advocate for me (I was a new guy, he'd been there 10+ years), but man.

When he made points I didn't agree with, I agonized and questioned myself and tried to see it from his point of view, etc. When I still disagreed, I wrote and rewrote to phrase it without logical sleight-of-hand, and hopefully without unkindness. He pretty quickly started responding with what I now see as alt-right talking points and argument styles: lots of name-calling or implicit ad hominem insults, characterization of my positions as reductive, demeaning labels (e.g., I voted Democrat the previous election, so I was a \"commie\" or \"socialist;\" I supported basic gender equality so I was a \"feminazi,\" etc.). It fell apart.\n\nLater: HS friend was in Afghanistan as a \"consultant\" after serving a tour or two with the Air Force. He replied to a FB post of mine opposing the war and the underhanded erosions of checks and balances in how it was being waged. He did something like demand one piece of evidence of even a single... whatever. I linked him a story about drones being used to kill people with very little evidence of their identities, and then to kill family members at the funeral. He called me lots of names and did a bit of \"How daAaAre you\" that I've seen from certain kinds of military personnel. We haven't spoken since.\n\nFamily friend back when I was church-going came to the halloween Trunk or Treat in the church parking lot driving her pickup covered in Republican candidate flags (literal ones, of the kind that would all now say \"Trump\", but this was about 2007).

Online convo (again) about asylum seekers, refugees, immigrants, etc. (long pre-Trump). He wades in with Sean Hannity talking points. I fire back with some evidence. He makes some comment, I think, suggesting I should shut up because the US was the best, most humanitarian place in the world. I respond with a link to a story about Jewish refugees being turned away during WWII. He and I (and cousin) were in the same religion, so he comes back questioning my faith: My use of information and citations suggested I was getting \"Too learn\u00e9d\" (subscript: therefore prideful and wicked and not to be trusted). I called him on his bullshit, something like \"It's not cool to hide behind religion just because you're losing an argument.\" I haven't spoken to him or my cousin in a decade or more.\n\nYeah, I've lost lots of friends.

People will play the both sides game for the toxicity but let's be honest. One side is a reaction to the toxic nature of the other. \n\nThe left wants universal healthcare, free education for all. The right wants to take people's rights, spend money on pointless walls, committed 3 genocides (intentional mismanagement of COVID, detaining refugees in substandard living conditions during covid and doing nothing to help prevent it, causing many refugees to die, and the forced hysterectomies at the border) \n\nLike you spell those basic things out and people think you're the extremist.

We have the means, we just have people working to make other people's lives worse even if it ruins their lives too. \n\nThe other side wants people in the country to lose their rights, to kill certain groups, to hate others indiscriminately, etc. All a choice for them to believe that. \n\nSo I cut those people out. They're horrible people and I'm not going to act like they aren't. And it's not even just propaganda or media to blame.

I told him that I would not longer be discussing anything political with him. Since then we get together occasionally, usually with a few other family member for lunch, and we mostly talk about old times and what's going on in our kids lives etc.  The racial insult problem OP mentions is definitely something that needs to be called out and probably would lead to a major break in a relationship.", "I had to cut off two friends, but neither of them were close friends. They were friends from long ago who I may have seen every ten years or so, and communicated with via email or text every now and then. They're both super right-wing now and belive in many outlandish conspiracy theories. They were apolitical when I knew them. They were radicalized over the last six years or so. Trump, Fox, OANN, Facebook--the usual culprits. Neither have any education post high school so that's part of it--they may have been more susceptible to misinformation, but I have other friends who didn't go past high school who are not like that at all, so it's not just that.  \n\n\nOf my close group of friends, I lost no one. We're pretty much all on the same page. politically. I'm happy that I was picky and chose my friends with care.   \n\n\nI have a couple of cousins who are Trump suporters, and religious (Catholic) but they aren't pushy about it. I see them at family get togethers every couple of years and no one talks politics. Or maybe they talk politics among themselves but they don't to me, which is nice.  \n\n\nMy biggest problem is a brother-in-law who, prior to Trump, was as apolitical as you could get. He didn't graduate from high school and seems to have little intellectual curiosity, but he's not stupid, by far. He's very good to his friends and family, but he's racist against black and brown people, and immigrants. This is partially because of the people he works with, and the influence of some in-laws from the other side of the family who are full MAGA. He's easily influenced. He got Facebook a few years ago and it was a downhill spiral. We try to see him and his girlfriend for a meal and there will invariably be a \"joking\" comment made about hispanic people or immigrants and it's really awful, to the point that I don't want to be around them anymore. They seem to have no clue how offensive the things they say are. He would give you the shirt off his back, but only if you're his good friend or family. He has lots of guns, but he loves animals and nature and doesn't hunt. Lots of contradictions.  \n\n\nIt's a real dilemma. My husband (his brother) is upset about it too but loves his brother and wants to see him. I always enjoyed him, but since 2016 it's been really hard. The racist comments are usually couched in \"humor\" and can be very subtle, but they are unmistakable and it sickens me,", "Yup!  Trump really helped draw the line and enabled us to see others as they really are.   It often feels like the contrast between good and evil has been clearly revealed.", "Yup. I'm from a small town, so most of my cousins are hardcore Trumpers. Not a huge loss, I can deal with that one. The one that hurts is my older brother. I used to respect his ideas and his intelligence, but he's gone full MAGA, and even into Q territory. His Facebook page is a constant attack of false outrage against everything Democrat. Any time I point out verifiably false information he just gets pissed. It's hard to hang out with him now, let alone respect him. It's really hard to give up, but I'm at a total loss of what can be done. \n\nI've only lost one close friend to politics, but on the other end. He suddenly went very very far left. Everything is racist and white people are bad(he's white). The hatred is at least as bad as anyone on the Trump side of the spectrum. Not as much conspiracy and misinformation, just hatred.\n\nEdit- sorry for sharing my experience? If you're downvoting, do you mind telling me why?", "Yes, no and maybe since it certainly polarized me and them. I hated Trump, my best friend loved him and we decided to disagree and not talk about it.

I\u2019m not interested in standing with anyone who stands with those policies or the people enacting them. \n\nPolitics didn\u2019t destroy those relationships, it just made it clear that some people around me have values diametrically opposed to mine.

I still have work goals and deadlines to meet but also get to be home with my pets, turn on some cheesy game shoes or reality tv in the background, etc. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s a work from home opportunity that could work for you?", "I'm 44 and have worked hard to build a career in tech that a lot of people would be envious of, but I also feel the same way that you do. I'd rather be free to pursue my own interests and find other ways to contribute something. I'd rather work to make the planet better or contribute to the betterment of humanity than make my CEO richer.\n\nThe problem is that as my income levels rose my living expenses did as well, so I'm not able to quit and find a more fulfilling job and pay the obligations that I've gotten myself into. So the best suggestion that I can offer, especially since you're newly married, is to live as far below your means as you reasonably can. Not having to stress about money contributes a lot to happiness. Not needing to make $100k+/yr opens up a lot of opportunities to work for non profits where you can make a difference.", "[deleted]", "I've felt this way since I was in my 20s. I'm 61 now. The feeling has never gone away--and like you, I don't dislike my job and the work makes the world a better place. I don't know that there's a solution. For me, I keep hope alive by buying lottery tickets. I know the odds are against me and I don't spend a lot of money on it, but I'm consistent and that was all I could come up with (because financially my work could never put me on a path to wealth or early retirement).", "r/leanFIRE is something to check out. \n\nI hate working so much that my broke ass has pondered roughing it.  Seriously.  I\u2019m hoping for a small (or large, lol) lottery windfall.

Some dude I knows Son, will retire when he\u2019s 50, with no college education btw.  It\u2019s doable if your income is high enough, I say.  For me, I didn\u2019t even make a living wage until I was in my mid 30\u2019s, and I\u2019m about 10 years past that now, paying for bad decisions.\n\nI say, figure out a realistic to you, and cut strategy.  Hopefully the new wife is on board.  Take care !!", "I try to remember what life would have been like had I been born at nearly any other time in human history. Say what you will about the work week grind, it sure beats being torn apart by lions or living your entire life without pain reliever. We really don't have it that bad.", "First, coming back from not just a wonderful vacation but your honeymoon with a wonderful new bride is the most unfair comparison point for your job. The human brain works on contrasts, and that would make many situations look terrible in comparison. So keep that in mind, though it doesn't mean you don't actually wish you didn't have to work.\n\n> I want to spend my time with my wife, I want to spend my time reading, listening to podcasts, watching films or going hiking or playing in the garden. In yet I know that this dream will never happen until I'm old and my body is broken. \n\nLet's try to mitigate that a bit. \n\nFirst, you *can* do *quite a bit of* of all that right now, every single day of your life, even while working full time. There are about **72** non-work hours in a waking week assuming you sleep a full eight hours every single day and work 40 hours a week. You might say, oh, but what about commuting to work? Well, that's an opportunity to listen to podcasts or music or, if you take public transportation, to read. I polished off some classic 1950s science fiction short stories while taking the Boston T years ago. 72 hours worth of reading, podcasts, films, hiking, playing in the garden, and spending time with your wife. Every single week. And that doesn't count vacation weeks, when you would have 112 hours--and will ramp up the novelty and richness of your experience.\n\nAnother factor is that since the brain does work on contrasts, the non-work time may be felt as even more valuable and enjoyable to you. Sure, being home with your wife all day every day might be great, but you might really savor it more and enjoy the anticipation of it more if you are forced by circumstance to be away from her at work each weekday a bit. So the 72 hours may be somewhat enhanced to some degree.\n\nThe other point is this bit about it never happening until you're old and your body is broken. That just seems way too pessimistic, for two reasons. One is that you may find you retire earlier than you expected. You should begin to look into that now and see if you can aim to retire as early as possible (r/FIRE, r/leanFIRE, etc.) The other is, even if you retire at 65 or even 70, your body certainly does not need to be \"broken\" by then. I am continually inspired by people who are running marathons in their 70s and plan to stay in great health and fitness as long as I possibly can, even into my 90s. That may sound absurd, but you won't even be in your 80s for almost another half century--can you imagine the medical progress by then? Especially considering we only recently have begun to get things like CRISPR, serious AI power, big data crunching, etc.? \n\nSure, you might say, but I want to do 112 hours of that. I don't want to sacrifice 40 hours each week. And I get that, and I empathize. But you probably also don't want to get colds and flus, or hear about tragedies in the news, or die someday, or meet jerks, etc. It's just part of the unfortunate things of life that you can't entirely control. What you can do is strive vigorously to make the best of it. Find an even funner job if you at all can. Find other sources of income (passive, investing, side hustles you enjoy and maybe can even do together with your wife, performance, etc.) Work ~~hard~~ smart to retire early. Don't waste the 72 hours you do have now. Plan amazing vacations. Etc.\n\nAnd please remind me to do the same.", "Don't have kids and just enjoy your weekends, evenings, vacation time and days off.", "Okay, I've been where you are. There IS a fix: be ridiculous. \n\nWrite down a list of demands for yourself. \"Work any hours I want, earn XYZ dollars, hang out with friends for a living, etc\" Don't be reasonable.

Some people are fortunate to do something they LOVE but the vast majority of us aren't (and even those lucky ones still probably feel stifled by the routine). Ultimately, it comes down to a perspective shift. Our default mode of being is not and likely cannot be leisure/free time. And so we have to value those moments when we do have them, but not expect them to be constant.\n\nWith that said, there are a number of things you can do to improve this routine. Maybe you can shift professions to something that feels more rewarding to you. Maybe you can work towards an early retirement.

When my parents were in this age range, they pretty much did nothing but work, run errands, do things around the house and watch TV. My older brother and I were both in marching band at the same college in another city so they spent a lot of Saturdays from the late 80s to mid-90s out of town at college football games but they didn't seem to have any friends, hobbies or social life. I often think to myself \"I have no idea how to be this age.

Seeing those people talk about traveling internationally for the first time, changing careers, moving to another state or country, starting to invest for the first time, finally starting and maintaining a fitness routine, dating and getting married, buying their first house, overhauling their wardrobe, etc. is a great reminder that being in your 40s and 50s is different now from how it's ever been before and there are very few limits on what you can do as long as your health, time and finances allow it.", "Will be 50 this year.

Their losses even surpassed the 13.1 billion that the hedge fund was worth.  \n\nEventually the hedge fund had to close their short positions and buy all the Gamestop stock back at much higher prices, causing the price to go up even more.\n\nThat is called a \"short squeeze\".\n\nNow the hedge fund is declaring bankruptcy, and the reddit thread is combing through other hedge funds with massive short exposure so they can short squeeze them into bankruptcy as well.  \n\nAll of Wall Street is saying that the public joining together in this fashion should be illegal, but really they just lost at their own game to ordinary people.\n\n---\n\nThe  /r/wallstreetbets side of the story is that hedge funds do what they did all of the time, but the losers are usually the little guy, as in the economic collapse of 2008.

It worked like a charm for awhile...then I learned how to run from cops and I did it quite often. Three obstruction charges later I met a woman that I truly loved and still do. Something about her made me want to be a better man...She was pretty. While I was with her I held a modest job down, I gave up drinking and smoking and even though she dumped me for sponging off of her it was a big step for me. I got sober and I could think. I have since then grown up a lot. I still struggle to hold down jobs because I am very prone to outbursts, I am getting there. One day at a time. It is easy to get abandoned in this \"land of the free\" of ours. All you have to do is destroy someone else's playboy mansion delusions with your presence. \nDon't invite someone into your home expecting a sitcom. It is going to suck when you realize that you have made yourself into an all in one resource. If you open your home to someone you have to set very hard boundaries from the beginning. Some people are just not able to be helped. If you give them a shelter from the cold you have to share your dinner and give free rides too. What are you going to do,say no? \n A smart phone is a lifeline for someone that wants to get out of the downward spiral. You can get a job, directions to that job, cry for help, watch youtube tutorials, get any book in print for free...so if someone is crying for help and playing \"candy crush\" on the couch at the same time, leave them wanting. Your first obligation is to yourself and it is your responsibility to make responsible choices. Think about that before you fall for the next sad story. There are people that are helpable out there in some really bad situations. You can judge a tree by the fruit it bears. Get advice from experts. People in the Narcotics anonymous and Alcoholics anonymous programs can be of good counsel in these matters because they are very well practiced at dealing with the hard cases. Get a support system in place before you make a move to open your heart up and make a difference in someone's life. If you do it right you can leave an impression on somebody that will change their outlook on the world, but most people do not have the right temperament for it. Stupid people attract stupid people.

Smartphones are essential in today's world; ubiquitous, sure! But that doesn't mean laptops and PCs all of a sudden aren't! What happened to making websites actually usable and decent to experience on the superior platform? Hell, half the time these \"mobile-first\" websites which are used on all platforms don't even work at all on my iPhone!

I absolutely hate tipping. It has gotten completely insane. It is made to make you out to be the bad/good guy where there should be no goddamn judgement at all. I grew up Catholic, and that kind of guilt crap haunts me, and I wish it would stop!\n\nToday, I went to a new salon to get my hair worked on. I expected to pay a hefty price as my hair and beard have not been touched for two years by a professional. So, I got a recommendation from a friend and scheduled an appointment. There was no discussion of price what so ever. I told the owner \"You are the professional. I am here to look good. Please make it so.\" And she did her best. As she was the owner, she had two other women running around doing things from mixing color to washing my hair, sweeping up, etc. while she is also working on other people. You know, these women are her employees.\n\nSo, after everything is done, the owner inspects the work, and we agree it is good, but may need some changes next time. Fine. One of her underlings checks me out at the register, adds up the total to  $219. I tap my  phone on the payment device and I thought I was done.  The underling says would you like to use \"Tippy\". I ask, \"Huh, what is that?\" And she points to something I cannot read because I do not have my glasses, she starts saying something about tips. Now, WTF?! I just paid $200+ for a service, and now I  am supposed to tip? How much am I supposed to tip? Do I have to tip everybody? WTF? Do I have to tip the owner? My god, I did not know what to do. This is an app? Is thing added to your card, WTF is this? Frustrated into not doing anything I pulled the last $10 bill out I had in my wallet and left it on the counter saying \"How about I just do this?\" And she gives me a pouting comment, \"What ever, floats your boat.\" Arrrgggg! Jesus Fucking Christ!! Am I now a bad guy? WTF? I should not be made to perform here. I just wanted and got a fucking haircut.\n\nWhy do I have to tip everybody? Just pay your fucking employees and charge a proper price for it. For chrissake, if she charged me $260 I would have been fine with it. If she wants to give her employees 15% of the bill, that is up to her, not me. It is her business, not mine. I do not have to know about it or care.

Yet, I have no idea if her employees got that cash. So that would have been $30/each to them if she did not take any for herself. I have no idea. It appears their use of Tippy is new, so I tried to educate them that this \"app\", more like the financial scum suckers at the helm of it, will garner upwards of 20% from them. The owner was quite polite and jovial, but she said something that kind of shocked me, but did not really shock me, \"Oh, if you don't tip them, I tip them them,\" while patting her chest to emphasize the \"I\".

At a good cafe, they're not pushing a button. They're total technicians, and an amazing latte has - not exaggerating - gotten me teary eyed.

He had an interesting response. He said, work is important. It\u2019s not everything, but it\u2019s such a big part of life that you should give it some weight and meaning, and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re just going to end up miserable.\n\nHe told me another story about some work seminar he went to with managers from a bunch of different companies and the leader was talking about how to motivate employees and give them pride in their jobs and meaning in their work, and one of the managers raised his hand and said, \u201cUh, sir, I work in a chick rendering plant... and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever _seen_ a chick rendering plant, but uh, it ain\u2019t meaningful and it ain\u2019t never gonna be.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know where I was going with this.

It looks like you haven't found that after 22 years. In your 20s and 30s, it's easier to power through it because you're looking for opportunity and have the energy, but it does get old.\n\nI promise you that companies like this do exist. Look for a \"culture of empathy\"; mention it in your first interview with a hiring manager. It sounds cheesy, but companies that emphasize it are great places to work.  You come back each day energized, even if the work takes it out of you.\n\nI started my career working in a place that was \"all right\", looking back on it. I had to deal with a VP who wasn't even in my neck of the company hierarchy taking about 20% of my time each day doing rudimentary crap for him. My own vertical couldn't do much about it because he was a buddy of the CEO; they contained the damage where they could. Eventually, it got to be a bit much, I was feeling growth constrained, and I left. The next year and a half, I changed jobs 6 times! It took me that long to figure out what I wanted, how to spot problem employers, and find one that I was willing to stick with.\n\nI went through companies that had attempted management coups, one where I reported to a CEO who was on cocaine, one that had an Amazon-like cut throat culture, one where I got fired to be made an example of, one that was customer-facing with terrible customers, etc. Eventually I found one that really tried caring about the employee, albeit with subpar implementation. 2 years later, I'm at my current employer. I caught their eye because a \"culture of empathy\" was something that I was specifically looking for; I liked the taste I got at my last gig. It wasn't in their handbook or company statement, just something that resonated with everyone that was at my interview (and this is while applying for a technical position).\n\nThe first couple of years here, I was doing work that didn't enthrall me. But every time I thought about leaving, the culture is what kept me here. I know what it's like out there, how long it takes to find all this what's around me, and I'm happy at work, even on days I have to work through the night or do something I don't want.", "I work at home and I feel the same way.\n\nMy current job isn't providing me with any sense of accomplishment at all.  I spend most of my day in meetings and doing bug fixes, being pulled off one piece of code to work on another constantly, which increase burnout from having to reload my mental space all the time.  In meetings especially, I have to keep reddit open just so I don't start dozing out of boredom while people discuss email templates and timeframes on projects I'm not involved in.\n\nMy previous one I had some sense of accomplishment for one project, but half my time was spent adding features to a gargantuan piece of shit project where the original coders believed in the block and copy style of writing code. (seriously I found at least 7 nearly identical subroutines to create an invoice!)\n\nI would have actually gotten a huge sense of accomplishment if they had let me spend time rewriting the worst of that code, but they didn't want to spend the money and time.  \n\nBut it's still freaking better than retail!", "I know that feeling all too well! People that actually enjoy their job and working are a big mystery to me. I sometimes wonder if they just don't know what else to do with them and their life. Is there really such a thing as enjoying work? Maybe if you are the boss of your own company, but with most jobs, you work to make someone else richer, and be able to pay your bills. How can that be fun? In the best scenario, it might be tolerable. But more often than not, you spend the majority of your time working so someone else can profit off you. You have to dress a certain way and behave a certain way just to fulfill other people's expectations. You cannot chose what people to spend your day with, and have to deal with whatever colleagues or customers you end up with. Your day is dictated by others. And during that bit of free time you have, you need to take care of all kinds of chores, too. I hate it, from the bottom of my heart. \n\nI'm very lucky that I was able to drop out of that hamster wheel a bit. Not completely, I still am working full time, but I am self employed and working from home, and I am working in a field that mixes with my personal interests. At least I don't have to dress up, commute, sit in an office and have to deal face to face with people I might not like every day. I can enjoy my own home, and the contact with other people I have is indirect. It saves me commuting time, so I have more time to spend on doing things I enjoy. But the thought of not being able to keep on doing things this way is truly scary. I don't think I'd be able to do it otherwise again. I'm actually a lawyer's assistant and the years working in this field still haunt me. I spent my days sitting in an office with a colleague who I didn't like, and vice versa, doing things that would make the rich people richer and was all about who was better able to make it sound like the law was on their side. Who could come up with more paid \"expert opinions\" that supported their client. My name is on books that were solely written to fuck others over. I entered this career thinking I could help making the world a better, a fairer place - oh, sweet summer child was I wrong! Ever since then, I have hated work. On some mornings, I was literally sick because I was dreading going there so much. On others, I hoped to be run over by a car - not to have a terrible accident, but maybe something like a broken leg that would allow me to stay home for a few weeks.\n\nIt's not that I am lazy or don't want to work. I love that feeling of completely losing yourself in something you can focus on, to get in the zone. Of looking back on the day in the evening and knowing that I got a lot done, that I was productive, that I filled my day with meaning.  But most jobs if you really look at them are just making sure that others can gain more profit. Maybe not if you end up working for a non profit organisation or are doing some kind of social work, but those often cost your soul too, just in a different way. I have picked up some hobbies to get that feeling of fulfillment, and look at work as a means to pay the bills and feed me. But if I was financially able to, I'd probably drop working completely.", "**Only** 18 more years and you can retire. \n\nGlass half full?", "I once complained to my grandfather about the same thing.

There's a Simpsons episode \"Maggie Makes Three\" that comes to mind constantly with this stuff.  I'm assuming you have kids and that's holding you in one place at a higher paid office job.  I'm held back in that way and fully intend to do what I can to make as much money as I can while my kids are dependent on me.  However, beyond that, I can think of many possibilities.  Maybe I could sell my house and buy a building to do a bed and breakfast in Mexico or Spain?  Maybe my playing around on the stock market will be something I can figure out how to do full time?

I will certainly need to work until circa age 65.\n\nThe bit that gets me is that my father (and my wife's father) retired in their 50s on good pensions after a full-time career with one employer. This option isn't available to me, and certainly won't be something my children will have available; defined benefit pensions that offer a guaranteed percentage of final salary are long-gone in the UK unless one is a Public Sector worker.

I finally graduated and started my career at 43, but it wasn't until I was 46 that I was able to start making any decent money. We bought a house and two years later my husband became disabled.

I don't feel it, maybe the practitioner does. I sit in an office and fill out forms to send to an insurance company so we all get paid for this. It all seems extremely silly to me, like a version of babysitting for adults, but you create the babysitting for yourself.\n\nThink about it, I make forms that people fill out and then do data entry on forms that someone else in another office made. And it's just an endless loop of forms. That's my life. I felt the same way about school, even though I was a good student. So many quizzes and essays on things that just felt like babysitting to me. \n\nOn the other hand, I started up two side businesses years ago. One with friends as an event planning company (which is obviously now defunct) and another as a baker. I've steadily been gaining business, even now in the pandemic.

Light hearted help with common orthopedic fucked up pain, but usually reflecting no serious problems.  Not a good idea to jump into this if you have spinal stenosis or a bunch of complicated post surgical stuff going on. At least not on your own.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, my uncle, who was a great guy, probably in his 70s, said \u201cWhen you get older, you have pain somewhere every day.  The day you wake up without pain, you\u2019re dead.\u201d  Funny at the time. Today, it\u2019s as real as (Choose your incredibly funny object to end the lame joke)\n\nThe ones that annoy me the most are pains that just occur suddenly for absolutely no apparent reason.  Many a day where I have been mild to moderate active, not overdoing it, and not under doing it.  Then there is suddenly an annoying pain, say in one of my glutes, and radiating down the left side of my leg.  Usually my wife is nearby, and I usually say something like, \u201cwhy does my ass hurt today?\u201c. I haven\u2019t gotten any sarcastic looks or remarks, from my wife, or from anybody nearby yet. But it\u2019s probably only a matter of time.\n\nI\u2019ve been worked up for chronic neck and low back pain. Nothing evident radiographically.  And physical tests, neurological physical exam is basically normal, not consistent with some sort of peripheral nerve damage, etc. 10 years ago, physical therapist tells me it\u2019s my posture.  Once I researched sufficient sources, it totally made sense.  But her exercises never really made much of a dent.  \n\nOf course, I basically sit all the time in my career. I also read a ton. It is difficult to read without bending your neck forward for an extended period of time. This eventually leads to very painful neck spasms, and pain in the general vicinity.  Sitting for an extended period flexes your low back muscles, and shortens and weakens other core muscles.  One wrong move, and back feels like a short vacation in Hell.\n\nI made a lot of ergonomic changes, which did help. But I would still get episodes of acute pain and spasm, primarily in my neck. About once a year it would hit my back.\n\nOne could say that I\u2019ve been working on this thing for about 15 years.  It can be painful and very annoying, but for me, luckily, it never lead to any prolong dysfunction. I know there are many people who have far more advanced and serious orthopedic conditions.  Also, I don\u2019t know what it means, but when there is some great cure touted online, or what have you, and it helps millions of people, I\u2019m never one of fortunate ones to improve.\n\nBut, about four years ago, I think I was browsing Amazon books on the issue, and I came upon two books, written by the same practitioner, Robin McKenzie.  He has two very small booklets ( treat your own neck; treat your own back). They cost about US$10 apiece. jampacked with extremely helpful information.  He\u2019s a physical therapist in New Zealand, but I\u2019m sure he passed away sometime in the last 10 years.  I read the booklets, highlighted things that seem to apply to me the most, and started the exercise programs he described.  The exercises are simple, don\u2019t require any paraphernalia, and also provide relief pretty much immediately if you are in an acute episode. Otherwise, the exercise strengthen the muscles that require it, and lessen the strain applied upon the weak muscles.  Requires about 10 minutes a day.\n\nmy chronic neck problem is about 95% better!  I didn\u2019t focus too much on the back exercises, because I figured with the correct posture, and moving around in general more, I probably wouldn\u2019t have another episode.  But I did some thing, and I\u2019m not even sure what it was. But I was and a lot of back pain and had the typical problems. His exercises for an acute flareup, did reduce the symptoms so that I could wok around and basically function.  \n\nSo I started getting heavy into his actually quite simple exercises and postures. It took a long time, about a month. But I completely healed, and actually my back is in better condition because I am maintaining the Recommended daily exercises for the back. Takes about 10 minutes.  \n\nAt the risk of sounding like a dork fanatic, I also recommend these physical therapists on YouTube. Bob and Brad \u201cthe most famous physical therapist on YouTube\u201c).  They are nerdy in a funny way, neither of them seem to have a mean bone in their body. They are sort of like characters from the movie Fargo, the nice ones.  But they know what they are doing, and they have many, many 10 minute videos on these sorts of issues, neck and back, as well as about anything else that tends to go badly involving the orthopedic system as we get older.  I was surprised that they also admire, and teach the McKenzie method (the two books I had read).  If anything is ailing you orthopedically, I think you will find some immediate help on their channel. If you do a deep dive, overtime, you might find a lot of other approaches that help a great deal of are mortal coils.\n\nThis is the first time I have ever recommended anything akin to the enthusiasm and length of post.

Lucky for me, that meant Violet Ruth & I would have time for a nice long walk (she in the super stroller, with cupholders & all) . After the usual route in my son's neighborhood, we were both still having fun. So I decided to cross the entry road to another neighborhood we'd not visited before. It was a generic condominium village, but had some nice swirly roads (all sidewalked), a few little hills interesting green spaces throughout.\n\nThe first area looked like swamp land, with tangled trees and brush up to the road and a small vegetation filled pond that was a magnet for some interesting birds. The next part of the neighborhood was clearcut with very few trees - fields of Green as I described it. Finally, the area between homes became very wooded toward the end of our journey - like an enchanted forest.\n\nAs we walked, I did my best impression of a Disney tour guide for Violet, describing each area we were in and it's character. We were a few steps into the enchanted forest when I peeked at Violet and she was sound asleep, two little dandelions still tucked behind her ears. I laughed and continued walking, silently.\n\nAll of the sudden, I hear a voice from about 20 feet behind us. \"Oh no!! Please don't stop your commentary. My wife & I are enjoying every word!\" It was an older gentleman and his wife - who had been within earshot since swamp land, quietly walking behind us.

Amazon prime was $79 when it launched in 2005, and inflation has gone up 53% since then.

I suppose that makes sense if you only use the membership for shipping but that is like having a gym membership just to use the showers in the locker room.

I use my Twitch Prime sub every month, so that alone is like $6, I actually do find a lot of the free Prime Gaming loot to be relevant to me whether it be cosmetics, or actual AAA free games from time to time. Prime video included with it is useful to me every so often that they release a new season of a show actually worth watching on there. \n\nPlus I live near a distribution centre so I'm pretty much guaranteed 1-2 day delivery on anything, and having that even for just the little things we need each month that are hard to find in stores is worth it.\n\nBut yeah, honestly you just gotta add up the monthly costs and see if it's worth what you're getting out of it or not.", "Wow, I didn't realize how high the cost had creeped up.

Like since the \u201890s. I first noticed this when I was in college back in the day. Remember the big push for Ebonics then? Ironic that the people pushing it were mostly highly educated black people who  spoke flawless English. I was like, Oh they\u2019re just getting over, this is a way to make a good living. But the fallout of that was then racist white teachers, whether they were liberals or conservatives, then used that as an excuse to further lower expectations of black students in terms of teaching and holding them accountable for not only speaking but also reading and *writing* English. Ultimately these kids got shafted by the ebonics push, because if they went on to college they couldn\u2019t pass the placement of exams so had to take at least a year of remedial English. That they had to pay for, of course.\n\nAlso in the \u201890s, myself and most of my friends were \u2018activists\u2019 meaning we went to a lot of rallies and marches but it was mostly talk. A few instances stood out to me that had me like, WTF these people are crazy. Remember\u2019Take Back the Night\u2019 stuff? First one I attended at college was an eye-opener. I couldn\u2019t believe how all the older feminists, grown ass women who should have known better, were so insistent that young women basically put themselves in danger because we \u2018should\u2019 be able to go out at night with the same freedom and safety as men. Ok sure, we SHOULD, but in the real world we CAN\u2019T without being in more danger, so why pretend that throwing young women to the wolves, who just got out of high school (girls still basically) is going to change things??\n\nAnother one that had me messed up was attending this meeting regarding helping prisoners. They went on and on about the racist justice system, which was fine, but what had me messed up was the complete lack of acknowledgment of and empathy  for the BLACK victims of black rapists and murderers. I was sitting there with a bunch of white people telling me we needed to write letters and send care packages to black men who had KILLED people  because it was \u2018the system\u2019 that caused them to be that way. When I pointed out the utter racism and absurdity of that it was like I\u2019d sh!t on the floor. But they quickly recovered and then condescendingly repeated the nonsense, just slower this time. I guess because I\u2019m also black I can\u2019t be expected to understand right away lol. I called them a bunch of racists and left. \n\nSo yah I have noticed this continued with Millennials and got even worse with early Zoomers.

Can you give an example?", "I'm going to be very direct, but don't take this as me trying to be overly critical of you or anything like that.\n\nFrankly, it seems like you don't really want a dialogue yourself based on some of the things in your post.  You complain about \"the reddit woke lord bubble\", \"These dopes who keep screeching\", and \"a bunch of brainless zombies\".\n\nOn top of that, you say, \"Do you think these kids are gonna mature and get over this phase\" which is kind of in line with the false right-wing meme that people become politically conservative as they age.  You seem like you're equating moving outside of certain political views with maturity.\n\nNow all that aside, I do believe you're politically left on the issues you say you are.  However, things have changed and some things are a little different.  For example, you say:\n\n> These dopes who keep screeching about equality and acceptance and unity keep making new boxes to put people in and seperate them by. That used to be real actual racism when the goal was a \"color blind society\" but we've just dropped that I guess.\n\nThe problem is that MLK Jr never really wanted a color-blind society, but rather one that accepts all colors.  So if there's a white blonde American kid, a black American kid, and a Chinese American kid all in a classroom together they can still be individuals as well as representing their upbringing and culture without needing to conform or pretend that they don't have any differences.  Rather than trying to create uniformity the goal is to treat people as equals while respecting their differences.  I think you'd probably subscribe to that as well.\n\nThe other thing is that you are complaining about \"woke\" people.  The only people I hear using that word all the time are on the right.  It sounds to me like although you are probably politically on the left, you have some source of information that is on the right and likely pretends that they are on the left.  This could be someone like Joe Rogan or Sam Harris who are kind of stealth right-wing people who are in favor of legalizing pot and in favor of gay marriage.  Basically what these type of people do is take some mundane situation like a student organization on a college campus sending out an email with a stupid statement, and blow it out of proportion and act like everyone on the left from Joe Biden down is pushing for this kind of stuff and it's high on the Democratic agenda.  These types of people yell constantly about how politicians on the left never put their attention on decrying college students who publish dumb emails and whatnot as evidence that they're in favor of it.  The stuff you're complaining about just isn't a major part of most people's lives, even on reddit.\n\nOn the \"latinx\" thing that someone else mentioned, there have always been more people complaining about it as \"woke gone wrong\" than have ever used the term.  I speak Spanish and know a lot of latinos and nobody uses that term including the college student latinos that I know.  It's something that seems to have been popular on a few college campuses and a few people in the media have pushed it but it's never been that big of a deal because almost nobody likes it.\n\nThat being said, sure, there are young people with dumb views, and based on what we've seen with the transformation of the GOP into some sort of weird corrupt TV billionaire fan club I don't think being an idiot is limited to any age group.  However, you'll be less frustrated if you spend your time talking to people who you can have productive conversations with, and spend less time interacting with sources of information that piss you off.  I hope my reply didn't come off as too harsh but I hope to be helpful and give you something to consider.", "I'm hoping there's some maturation (lord knows I had some pretty loud and inflexible political opinions in my youth) but some of this is just a consequence of the social media era broadly, I'm afraid.\n\nMy primary means of news consumption is now my local newspaper, in deadtree form, every morning.  Might have lost my mind by now otherwise.", "I'm not sure where you've been wading, but I'm selective in where I actually engage in political discussions, despite being fairly left leaning.\n\nI know I currently differ from the current young left (on the millennial/Gen x cusp personally) is the preservation of certain rights and principles vs. outcomes. There was an old Onion article titled \"ACLU defends KKK's right to burn down ACLU HQ in protest.\" While hyperbole, that was not far off from the objectivity that the ACLU once strove for. But they themselves have pivoted to be in line with the modern social justice movement. \n\nAs their former head Ira Glasser said in an interview, he supports their goals, but they seem too quick to forget that part of the reason that the absolute rights were fought for so hard was that the modern left's opinions were in the minority. Now that it has become more main stream, that seems to get lost. \n\nI think the modern counterpoint would be, though: High minded ideals are great, but it's a lot easier to be a champion of the exception and prudence of action when you aren't getting crushed by the rule. Since you brought up MLK in your post, I have to say that I had my own perspective challenged reading [Letter from a Birmingham Jail](https://www.csuchico.edu/iege/_assets/documents/susi-letter-from-birmingham-jail.pdf). \n\n\n>To me it seems you can be so woke that it comes all the way back around to being racist.\n\n\n \nYea, this is the classic [horseshoe theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory) . I'm not sure that I completely by this. There is a bit of paternalism in some of what you're talking about, though. I don't think it comes from thinking they \"know what's best for minorities better than they do\".\n\n\n\nHere's the thing, I think there are two different factors in play here:\n\n* \"The cable New mentality\": An ironic choice of term by me, as most of the people you are talking about don't really watch much cable news, but the point I think still stands; people are much quicker to turn to quick, low logic, regurgitated sound bites in any political topic (and we keep expanding the topics that are political somehow) than ever before\n\n* Less people discuss/argue in good faith, particularly on the internet: That is where the idea of the \"enlightened Centrist\" first came from. There are accounts making the same claims in your middle paragraph from supposed \"walk away\" liberal accounts that have been shown to be astroturfers.  I don't think you are, but it does come off as a hyperbolic characterization similar to what you feel is being done to you.\n\n>That used to be real actual racism when the goal was a \"color blind society\" but we've just dropped that I guess.\n\nThe modern left has dropped the principle of a color blind society, I'll agree with you on that. I don't think that it is a completely terrible thing. I think it's reasonable to acknowledge differences. I probably take the same exception that you do, that there seems to be a contingent that too often only defines things by them. I do think some of this comes back to my point about groups not arguing in good faith, though. You may remember  a few year ago a Republican rallying cry being \"we believe in equality of opportunity, not outcomes.\" I completely agree with that on the surface, but can't take it seriously from a group that does nothing to improve the lowered opportunities of those born as a minority **or a lower class**.

So they come to the \"and this is where I draw the line\" point, but it has nothing to do with the actual issue, just that the point of \"too much change\" is reached.\n\nAnd I get that.

There are a lot of word-games and double-binds ... a member of an oppressed group that doesn't feel personally oppressed has \"false consciousness\" and has internalized his/her oppression. If you disagree with a particular point, it's because either you don't understand it, or you seek to maintain white supremacy (those are the only two possibilites.) Not including black narratives is racist omission, including black narratives is racist appropriation. \n\nIt's driving working-class voters to the Republican party. The left doesn't talk about \"class\" now, the left talks about \"privilege.\"", "might worry about such criticism if I saw a shred of evidence millennials or younger are capable of effecting any social change whatsoever - eg Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, EPA/Clean Air Act, ERA, Vietnam war shutdown, etc. Plenty of causes are in need of their activism, COP26 failure, insane tuition and housing increases, voter suppression legislation, etc but ...if it involves more effort than clicking up/down arrows, just  fugget about it.", "FUCK YES.

That\u2019s just surface level politics\n\nLeftists care about the system itself, which includes AA, lgbt recognition, critical thinking about race, class and social institutions, etc.\n\nSo, if you like the shallow leader stuff but not the deeper policies, or the ideologies that influence the crafting of those policies re:identity politics\u2026 what are you left about?\n\nHow can you be for left policy like public health while arguing that minorities are being treated like they\u2019re incapable *mostly because they are encouraged to access welfare and assistance, a similar mechanism to the public healthcare assistance/subsidisation*\n\nSure, young white liberals can be loud and misdirected. Their position in the white society means their voice is the strongest, and so advocacy for other groups will be in their voice\n\nBut the alternative? Minorities are still ignored without that large and vocal representation\n\nSo arguing that it\u2019s bad and wrong of young white liberals to be so vocal essentially cuts minority representation at the legs.

Ever heard the phrase \"Reality has a Liberal bias\"? Because it's true. If you don't adequately pay your workers to have extra money, how can you expect them to partake in a consumer based society? Without proper redistribution of wealth, even via taxes to cover things like medical and education, a consumer based society collapses. If we don't renewably fish and farm, how can we expect the land and animals to sustain us? That's how we caused the dust bowl and now severe overfishing. Without investing in proper infrastructure our electrical grids and other key infrastructure will continue to fail. Without investing in renewable energies our pollution will continue to choke and warm this planet until it can no longer sustain us. \n\n>Do you think these kids are gonna mature and get over this phase or do you think it's the new normal?\n\nYou obviously don't understand the very real changes our planet is going through right now, and the fact that only policy from the left is going to fix it. \n\nThe American political scope has ratcheted so far right that it's flirting with fascism.

It usually comes over as the naive enthusiasm of a first-year sociology student who just read their first text on Marxism, read some sassy Marxist tweets and is ready to seize the means of production. That's ok, because everyone has to start somewhere, but the lack of nuance from the loudest internet leftists is kind of exhausting. But as soon as you mention words like naive or nuance you're guilty of being a liberal centrist, and therefore one bad day away from being Hitler.  People treat leftist ideology like it's a k-pop fandom, and they might be having fun but it's not constructive.\n\nLike a good Marxist, I blame structures rather than individuals; the places on the internet where ideology is performed systematically reward simplistic, extreme opinions and punish nuance and uncertainty.", "The first rule for anyone who reads anonymous social media is that you should never assume that the posts are in good faith, or even people at all.

This means hiring people to post under different accounts, or hire people to write bots that respond on topical posts. \n\nSo when you complain about those \"woke\" people on reddit, you are making a dangerous assumption that those are actual people. It would also be dangerous and na\u00efve to assume that this post itself wasn't written by a bad faith actor. It pushes certain agendas that many groups want: Division, especially between \"younger generation,\" \"woke\" people. \"Woke\" people are ignorant and should be ignored. Downplaying racism, even twisting it so that those who work to dismantle racism are the real racists. The biggest one, of course, the entire point, is that the status quo should be maintained, and anyone who speaks out about it are irritating and should be silenced. That is the one concept that nearly every bad faith actor pushes, either subtly or overtly.

Your second mistake is discussing politics different from the hivemind of the particular subreddit you frequent.  Your third mistake is misunderstanding the nature of political discourse on social media.             \n     \nThe people discussing politics on reddit generally are 1)assholes who genuinely believe that everyone else is stupid and they're the last line of defense against fascism/communism, 2)trolls that want to make you angry whatever your position 3) paid or unpaid shrills who's goal is to boost or discredit a particular agenda and 4) people who just want validation from people who share their beliefs.  You can't assume that anyone argues in good faith anymore, and you can't \"win\" a debate, even if your position is that Nazis are bad.  The best you can do is counter the BS you feel like in the hopes that someone who reads through the thread will say yeah, that makes sense.                 \n\nHaving said that, I'm not all \"reddit and the youth are bad.\"  People rightfully scorn the reddit \"hivemind\" but it's not all a bad thing,  It's not a coincidence that I'm still on reddit while I deleted facebook.

If you're hurt that everything you say is completely reasonable, but people are attacking you, don't be.  it's not you and it might not even be your opponents being too \"woke\" either.  I don't know your experience with trolls but one of their favorite tactics is to appear reasonable while holding an unreasonable position, refusing to change despite all arguments to the contrary, with the goal of painting the other side as unreasonable fanatics.  (Not saying this is you!  Just as an explanation)  For example, \"Do your own research\" sounds eminently reasonable out of context, but in the context of anti-vaxers, it is a definite bad-faith argument because you can find \"research\" to support any batshit position and ignoring the 95% consensus among actual scientists to cherry pick the 5% that supports your favorite conspiracy theory is definitely bad-faith.  The thing is that trolls have used this tactic so much and it's so emotionally draining to get into the same arguments over and over knowing that 90+% of the time you're responding to a troll who doesn't care what you say, it's way easier to just dismiss everyone who posts something different from your viewpoint as a troll rather than to engage.

My position is that if one side becomes more extreme and the other side doesn't move, the center goes to the more extreme side and that rewards extremism because yesterday's fringe becomes today's center, and there are some things, like human rights you can't compromise on.               \n\nSo yeah there's my two cents about your thoughts.", " I'm a just right of center person.

A murder.  In every case the immediate reaction was shock.  'Cause young adults aren't supposed to die!\n\nBut then a strange thing happened.  People stopped dying.

We have a big house so it wasn't much of an inconvenience. Between no dry cleaning, lower gas bills, no commute, and my wife no longer having to travel for her job we only had to adapt to all of us living together 24/7, and that only took a few weeks. \n\nGranted nothing has changed other than the BIL and daughter moved back to their own places now, but gas is sky high again, everything is back to crowded, and eating out usually sucks as you have to wait for 20 to 40 min for a table as everywhere is understaffed (where I live no masks now at least).\n\n I am fortunate to be at an age where social gatherings/parties hold little interest for neither my wife or I. However, I can totally understand the teens thru 30's hating quarantine. I can only imagine how I would feel young and single trapped from my friends and potential romances. Luckily many friendships/romances are made and sustained online. Not like in my day, when you had to go out to meet people.\n\nI also really think that the work/social dynamic going forward has changed forever. Why do we have to go into an office to work as many have mentioned? Why if I, as an employer, have hardly any workers in the office do I have to maintain a large office footprint? If no one is renting office space, what am I, as the owner, gonna do with my office building that's at 20% capacity? SO many other things changed, and some of it for the better. Perhaps crushing the work dynamic from the 19th and 20th century is a great thing, setting the way for the future of earning a living in the 21st century. Malls, shopping in general, movie theaters, mom and pop shops, and boutique stores all struggling to find a way forward, finding workers and finding customers. Businesses have died... but many other ways to make a living have been created. Social/party/concert events and venues, IMHO, will continue their resurgence, it's in our human nature to gather. \n\nHaving reached the end of my career, moving forward into a new more flexible life, I am very interested to see where the generations immediately following me, make an new work force from home more than ever, and permanently. As others have said, I think about this a lot before and now. Priorities and available options have changed. A whole generation of kids has now experienced school (elementary through college) on a previously unknown reality. We don't even have to leave the house for food unless we want to. Why go out into the cold/flu/COVID crowds unless you want or have to? I know I don't and I love it!", "Yep. Realized just how much more time I had to myself since I didn't have to commute. Also saved $300 a month in gas. Working from home has its own stress, but it's different. I don't feel like kicking my neighbor's cat through the bushes any more.", "Hell no. Boring as hell, and I got tired of staring at my same four walls.", "No if only we could all be independently wealthy and not have to pay bills. Oh yeah forgot about those bills", "Agree completely! Really enjoyed being home away in my world full time.", "In my case, absolutely not. I also want to point out that I live in Germany and we are once again in the middle of a semi-lockdown, with a complete lockdown in the near future looking more and more likely everyday. \n\nI have been working from home now for about a year. In the past 10 months or so, I have been to my office a total of 2 times, as we are not even allowed to go in unless there is a very good reason. In a lot of ways, working from home *all the time* kind of sucks. For one thing, if you're working from home, it's real easy for employers to start to expect you to be always available for working on \"urgent\" issues that pop up on nights or weekends - because, after all, you're already at \"the office\" anyway. I know that this is supposed to happen, and that a lot of employers don't do this, but it shouldn't be that hard to imagine that there are companies who find ways to exploit the situation to their advantage.\n\nSecondly, another way always working from home can suck is that you are *always home*. Especially when restrictions and lockdowns mean that there really aren't many places at all you can go when you are finished working for the day. At least before, even if you didn't have a very exciting social life, you would still be out interacting with different people and seeing different things everyday just by having to go into the office\b. Now, there are times where I can go a few days without leaving the house other than to check the mail, and where I don't actually talk to another person other than my wife. In the summer I would go for walks in the nearby woods a few times a week just for a change of scenery, but now in December it's dark already by 5:00.\n\nBut for me the worst thing is that I have a pretty stressful job that can often get me a bit worked up. Which is normally fine, because at the end of the day when I finish working I just leave the office and go home. Except now, I work in my living room and find it harder and harder to separate the stress of my work with my home.\n\nSo no, lockdown has in no way, shape, or form made me happier.", "I feel it's unpopular to say this, but I am happy to be back at the office and at holiday parties and just out and about. I like hustle and bustle and I even like the commute as it separates my home life from my work life. I am also a single parent so I didn't have a spouse to hunker down with so maybe that makes a difference. I need my social life and I am more appreciative than ever of good friends and a strong community. If we lock back down again over the winter I will find it very, very hard.", "Nope. Became stupid isolated. Even after I started making phone dates with friends. I was depressed as hell. I kept looking at my dryer rope and wondering how it would look wrapped around my neck pulling me up a few feet.\n\nNo. I like things being open.", "It was a glorious 10 weeks that helped my wife and I pay off most of our debts", "I've been mostly working from home for years, so that part of my life wasn't affected much.   What I did like was:\n\n1.  Mostly empty highways and streets.\n\n2.  My mother lives near a mini mall, and there was no traffic to my mother's  house during the lockdown.", "[No, man.](https://tenor.com/VsJG.gif)", "I think being in covid lockdown all the time would be a huge bummer, just totally suck. But for a short time (a few weeks or months), it's more like a little reset button to your life + a little adventure.\n\nIt's like: if you were a kid and you want to watch a movie, but your parents never let you watch the TV and make you turn the lights off at 8, it sucks and you hate it. But if you're normally allowed to watch TV, but there's a big storm and the power goes out, it's awesome - it's a fun adventure - your parents go dig out the candles from the junk drawer, you start playing cards or board games in candlelight with your parents because it's not like they're going to do taxes or pay the bills in the dark, etc.. It would suck if that was your night every night, but it's super fun for a one-time thing, plus you may \n\nI think the covid lockdown was kind of the same thing. I don't think I'd like WFH forever, being stuck inside all the time sucks, it sucks not seeing friends and family, but for a few weeks or months where you don't have the option of going out, or doing anything but be alone with yourself, like being stuck at home as a kid when the power goes out and all the distractions go away, it's just a really nice reset button on what your day can look like.", "Jokes on you, I\u2019m still in lockdown", "The single largest improvement in my life has been the removal of my commute. Through a series of events, all a net positive, I ended up with one very negative repercussion, nearly 3 hours a day of commuting time. Prior to the pandemic I often worked from home once or twice a week but sporadically and not always based on the logic of whether or not I actually needed to be in the office. \n\nCovid changed that one aspect and made such an incredible improvement in my work/life balance. It was like quitting a part-time job I never knew I had! I have more time with my family, I slept later (and better!), I am eating better, and I have time for my hobbies. The irony is our team is actually measurably more productive, as well! \n\nWhile our company has made the collective decision that regular employees are to return to the office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and managers also on Thursdays, our department has been given the flexibility to take a bit more leeway. We'll see how it goes in January when we actually implement or return to office, but I can't see how I could ever go back to 5 days a week in an office to simply do the exact same work I can from home.", "Yes. So much happier. And I felt so much safer when I did have to go out - social distancing, I miss you!", "Yes. I was so exhausted and didn\u2019t even know it; I was on such edge around so many of our friends groups (I\u2019m lefty; they\u2019re right wing), and the pandemic allowed me some space to rest and refocus -and enjoy being home and caring for myself.", "I think our cats are the happiest of us all and expects the same \"special treatment\" ever since and guess what? Hell yeah!", "I'm in the middle on this. I liked being able to work from home part-time, but I missed social events with family and friends.

They're all adults but one 15 year old right now.\n\nI often wonder what it would have been like, because it was hard work, and it was very expensive.\n\nHaving kids kept us from lots of vacations to cool places.  It kept us from eating out a lot more than we did.  It kept us from lots of hobbies and activities.\n\nBut my kids are pretty darned cool.  They are my best friends.  We play a lot of games, do a lot of work and hang out together.  It's great to see them become their own people.\n\nTiresome?  No.  Tiring?  Yup.  Young kids are physically tiring, older kids are emotionally tiring.  I think it was worth it, personally, but I also have those fantasy moments of having a nice car and expensive vacations too...\n\nMy only advice is:  if you don't REALLY want kids, don't have them.  The world doesn't need more kids raised by half-assed parents.  There's no shame in not having kids, but being a parent that isn't really committed is bad news for the kids and everyone around them.", "Senior? Why I outta...\n\nMid 40s, happily married. No regrets. Rescue dogs and nephews are our joys.", "My wife and I have been married for 30 years. Though we initially thought it would be great to have kids (the period when lots of our friends were), we ultimately decided against it. Having covered that, keep in mind all of my information is strictly based on observation of my long term friends and family. \n\nLet\u2019s start with money since we\u2019re in the middle of such lovely times. I have no way of knowing how they are doing financially, and it\u2019s not my place to inquire. We\u2019re fine. Statistically speaking it costs about $230,000 to raise a child from birth to 17. This number seems ridiculously low. For one thing it doesn\u2019t count education. If you are in an area with outstanding public schools, you\u2019re golden. A lot of my friends sent their kids to private schools, most from K-12. If you calculate an average of $8,000 a year then they were looking at around $104,000 per child. Even without private schools there are a lot of other expenses. I don\u2019t know these things. I ask my friend, \u201chow much does it cost for Susie to attend cheerleading camp?\u201d A grand! Prom? $125. Yearbook? $100. Yada yada yada. \n\nThen there\u2019s healthcare. Coverage for me - $125 / month. Include the wife - $175. Include children- $380. Now those aren\u2019t exact numbers and some may find them high for the US. Some low. Either way you can quickly see that $230,000 growing. \n\nI asked my cousin if it was expensive to have children. He said only at first during the period when he had \u201cplay\u201d money, but before he adjusted to having none. As others have noted, if you surround yourself with couples in a similar situation, it\u2019s easier to adjust. \n\nWithout children we have invested a lot during our marriage. Money isn\u2019t a concern for us even in these crazy times. I still work and love my job. Am I getting paid at this time? Nope. I don\u2019t want to come off like a \u201cbig ass Tom\u201d (Forrest Gump), it\u2019s just a reality. We don\u2019t have to worry about children or grans. \n\nAfter money you have to decide the long term benefits. I won\u2019t even touch on this because (a) I have nothing to base my opinion on, and (b) results definitely vary by situation. I love my nieces and nephews and enjoy a great relationship with them. Are they going to take care of me? Doubtful. Are they going to be in a position to take care of their own parents? It\u2019s starting to feel increasingly not. As far as I can tell as they approach their early to mid 30s they can\u2019t really take care of themselves at this point. \n\nNow (and finally!), it\u2019s your decision. I don\u2019t believe you should evaluate whether or not you have kids based solely on economics. There is no way to put a price on the life I have lived and the love I continue to share with my parents and siblings. It is beyond measure. My friends and family are eternally grateful for their children. Through observation I have seen both the great and terrible. \n\nTL;DR- There is a cost to raising children, but only you will know if it is worth it. Our opinions are simply that.

Eventually, I ran in to a woman that \"could never have kids\".  Well, she could and did.  I was a father and she just wanted a child and a check.  I felt a responsibility to help raise the kid and actually had to fight to do so.  When I eventually got a custody order, I saw him every week.  She moved away and I drove 120 miles each way to spend a little time with him or bring him out for the weekends.  This went on for 19 years.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is I thought I'd never want to have kids but when I did, it changed my life.  I tried to be the best father I could be given the situation.\n\nNow he's living with me and a little over half way through college  and he's doing well.

You can still have a happy and fulfilled life with regret. I regret not taking my shot at Broadway (I had a good one) but chose a different route. I regret not taking my first college years more seriously because getting into a good career was harder and if I lose my job I\u2019d have to start over. But I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m really happy. Is life hard sometimes? Sure, but regret doesn\u2019t bring misery. \n\nI know you asked the opinion of child free people in their 50s but I feel like it\u2019s good to have the perspective of those in the thick of it. I have 2 small kids. I love my kids, but kids are hard, really hard. And it\u2019s the type of hard you can\u2019t fathom until you have kids. I had kids a bit on the later side and got to be single and then date my husband for about a decade before kids so I remember life with and without kids very well. \n\nWith kids- It\u2019s being exhausted 24/7 while they are little, it\u2019s becoming so vulnerable and adding potential risk of extreme loss that your world could be destroyed in a instant if anything happens to your kids. It\u2019s playing the lottery hoping they are and stay healthy. It\u2019s being willing to watch frozen 100000 times a week in a pandemic and basically never having control over the remote. It\u2019s forever being responsible for feeding another human and with uncertainty in the world sometimes that\u2019s scary, but feeding my kids right now oddly brings me quite a bit of joy. Its feeling on the border of sane and insane in the matter of a few hours on a daily basis, having days you love being a parent and days you want to run far, far away. It\u2019s never getting the alone time with your spouse you desperately crave because right now kids need you more and kids are expensive, so you put the vacations and alone time on hold and settle for quick \u201cI love you\u201d glances and dreaming together at 2 am with a teething baby and talking together about what you would love to be doing without the option of actually doing it.

In spite of challenges kids do bring a lot of joy, and it\u2019s an amazing experience to watch a small person grow. And the hope is by adulthood you get your time with your spouse back and can enjoy the company of the people you raised as well. \n\nRather than asking if you\u2019ll regret not having kids, ask if you want to commit to what it\u2019s going to take to raise them because regret doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be happy and fulfilled.

It's probably much easier to learn bullfighting.  Same goes for a wide range of disabilities.  One out of four American children now are either on or should be on an IEP, which is a special education plan for kids who are bully-magnets or otherwise won't have a great K-12.  \n\n\nAnd then you can get a perfectly healthy, cognitively advanced kid who blows every bit of potential and trust for something stupid like meth.

Not having children isn't selfish, because the non-existent child does not \"need\" or \"deserve\" anything.

We are biological machines whose primary drive is to propagate our genetic code. There's no virtue in doing it, it's just what we're programmed to do.

There are many levels of senior care, and range from 1. independent living, 2. supportive care, 3. assisted living, and 4. memory care, and 5. nursing care. I know where my mother currently resides in Memory care, they provide the first 4 of these levels. The independent living are quad-plex housing, which have everything.  Kitchens, garages, 2 bedrooms,  and full ADA accessible bathrooms.  The next is the supportive care, which can be that same facility, but they will check on you daily, provide meals, and minimal assistance. When you need more you can move to the assisted living area, and it provide all services, but you can come and go without restriction.  Finally, this facility has memory care, which provides everything except for those requiring full time nursing care, usually defined as skilled care. None of these are inexpensive, but the lower levels are not ridiculous pricing. Higher levels, such as memory care/nursing care, yes it can drain your finances in no time. For my mother, her Social Security and pension would pay for the service, with enough for food and insurance. Beyond the first 2 levels, less than 1/2 to only 1/3 of the cost are covered. \n\nI will add we attempted to place my mother in a supportive care facility, and she refused, saying \"I'm not ready for that\", yet in a few months we had to place her in assisted living - yes, it can quickly change!  \n\nThe supportive and assisted living will take you to appointments, outings and on shopping trips, along with providing your meals. \n\nI would check and see if the facilities you research would be willing to take on POA and Healthcare POA. The one thing I learned about most of these facilities is they charge based on your ability to provide your own care, with the exception being the independent living, since the assumption is you don't need any assistance. Which makes be believe they would assume some of those needs if pre-arranged. \n\nBTW, I can say from my mother's situation, she never believed or accepted she would need anything other than living independently in her own home, you are making the correct assumptions.  \n\nGood luck on whatever you discover fulfilling your needs.", "Having a kid or spouse just because you may need to be taken care of someday is no reason to have a kid or spouse.

I'm so happy about that, too, because I just can't deal with corporate BS anymore.  I'm posting this just to chat with anybody else here who might be like-minded.\n\nI had a great 20-year career as a software engineer... until the technology I was an expert in got (literally) retired into a museum and I didn't feel like going back to entry level to re-skill myself.  (That's an oversimplification.  I have some modern tech skills but I didn't have the energy to convince HR and hiring managers of that fact.)  After that I became an IT business analyst and I'm just over the 10 year mark for that.\n\nThe BA gig never really jelled for me like the software stuff did.  I was able to hide from a lot of the company/boss BS by focusing on my programming/system configuration/learning new technology.  But as a BA, yeah, focusing on Word documents just isn't compelling enough to let me forget the BS.  And I knew this going in, but BA is so much more people-focused.  I work well with people so in general it hasn't been a problem.  But it has shown me that I lack... social sophistication?...  nuanced relationship building skills?...  an ability to quickly connect with people and win them over, for sure.\n\nSo I've had more BA jobs in these past 10 years than software jobs in the previous 20.  Every job has had it's mix of toxic coworkers and BS, and I've always fussed about it.  But man!

Instead of making me more patient with my micromanager boss who treats me like an inexperienced kid (and then in our one on one meetings gaslights me with \"no, I think you're doing a GREAT job!\") it's all I can do not to tell him to shove it and quit.  I've only been in this latest job for just over a year.  For the first full year he wouldn't let me so much as raise a finger until he gave me the go ahead first.  (This after I've succeeded in other jobs with nearly full autonomy and responsibility.)  He's \"relaxed\" his control now to the point where he simultaneously expects me to just know to do things, and tells me I did them wrong, or starts telling me the next step to do, then the next then the next.  I'm confused.  Do I have a brain or not?  Am I doing everything wrong or not?  Eff it, who knows?\n\nIf I can only make it to Jan 15th, that's the date I'm shooting for.

The doctor we saw wasn't an oncologist and couldn't say how long he has left. But stats for 5 year survival rate with all possible treatment is bleak. \n\nIt breaks my heart that he's going to die so much sooner than the average life expactancy, it breaks my heart my children will grow up without their father.

Trying to keep everything going, with the added stress of all things medical and having to cancel days of work to get children from school etc. Looking after children and try to be normal and cheerful when I'm dying inside. The thought of having to do this for years fills me with dread. How? How can I do this? What if I get ill? Even just for a few days? \n\nI hate being vulnerable like this. People at work tells me I can do it, that I'm strong. And that's what's socially expected. But they don't know. They don't know. I didn't know.

You need to get a second opinion from an oncologist. Better yet, go to an oncologist that specializes in his particular cancer, preferably at a reputable cancer center such as MD Anderson, Fred Hutch or something along those lines. Seeing a specialist makes all the difference. I am a cancer survivor (Acute myeloid leukemia). I was originally diagnosed by an oncologist at a hospital, who wanted to treat me with standard tried-and-true old school chemotherapy. I went to Fred Hutch cancer center instead and participated in a clinical trial for a new chemotherapy regimen.

This sort of stress and fear really saps your mental and emotional reserves, and you are doing the heavy work with the kids and your husband.

I second this, and would add, if you're not in therapy now, you might want to find a therapist.  Caregiver burnout is very real, and having someone to talk with who is just focused on *you* can be a lifesaver.  Finding a therapist can be a long process, so think about doing it now, even if you feel you don't need it yet.  Don't wait until you're overwhelmed to start looking.", "I'm so sorry you are facing this.  I haven't been in your shoes, but I lost my mother and mother-in-law to cancer and I have a friend who has just battled it in her 40s (single mom) with a 10 year old child and pulled through. I've also been burned out at work and was put on sick leave for many months as a result.  It's not a good place to be.  My daughter was young then, but my husband was always traveling and we had a nanny.  Thank goodness for her. I can't tell you how grateful I was, even though paying her salary was financially very very tight.\n\nHere's my suggestion in addition to some of the great ones already:  get some house help.  Find someone good that you trust and who can help with the children and the housework.  Depending what you can afford, ideally a few hours every day  (e.g. after school, dinner prep, laundry, washing up, etc.)  \n\nFor now, while you're mentally and physically juggling everything, an extra pair of hands will be so helpful.  And if your husband pulls through... you don't know anything until you've seen the oncologist.  Chemo may work well, and it may all go into remission... then you won't need to keep the help.  And if the worst happens, you will already have someone who can keep helping with what you need.\n\nThe challenge (financials aside) is finding someone good, kind, trustworthy and who can help with special needs children.\n\nIf it's financially impossible, maybe you could find a live-in (grad) student who would trade doing house-help and child care for free room & board.\n\nYou're physically going to need help, and you will need the emotional space that having someone take care of the basics can give you.  It also means that you can spend time with the children and your husband on things that are really special for you and them, not just on the routine of cooking, cleaning, homework, etc.  \n\nTake care - hope that idea helps.", "Not to minimize the risk or the emotional trauma of something like this, because I've been through it, but actually I know a couple people in my family given 5 year life expectancy, one stayed alive for 10 years (colon cancer), and the other (ovarian cancer) is still alive 14 years later and is now considered cancer free. 5 years is a long time for medicine to advance and the situation to change, and it doesn't always change for the worse. If the life extending treatment works, there may be more life extending treatments or even cures in the future that life extension brings. Live every day like it's your last, but don't assume every day will be your last. Never lose hope! It's a long, cruel, heartbreaking rollercoaster with no guaranteed happy ending, but there's always happiness to be found if you know where to look.", "I'm so sorry that your family is going through this.  My daughter got cancer when she was 8, and trying to balance being with her with being with her autistic siblings was a nightmare in itself (her hospital was about 2 hours away from our house).  For the first few weeks we were told that she would likely die- we're lucky that she didn't, but that was just sheer luck. \n\nAnd like you, I was already exhausted before she was diagnosed.  Having 2/3 autistic kids (they were 7 then) was enough to already put me on the edge.  I'd sit in the bathroom at the hospital and just cry, or just start crying as soon as I got the other kids in bed. \n\nThe hospital will have resources, for you and your children.  We got a social worker through the hospital and she was wonderful.  There was also a grief group there for parents/spouses of people who were not doing well, and I think they saved my sanity.  The whole thing put me very off-kilter psychologically...it just seemed like every time I turned around there was another complication or crisis, and I'd already run out of steam before we even made it to the hospital.  (and the hospital was also excellent at helping my autistic kids as well...ask a social worker/nurse if they have a child life specialist there.  They'll do things like keep your kids entertained while you spend some private time with your husband, help the kids understand what's going on, and distract them when necessary.  Your local autism society also might be able to give you some help with that. \n\nFocus on one step at a time.  I had to write pretty much everything down at the time, because I was so stressed that my mind just basically stopped working except for worrying about things.  Don't be ashamed of asking for help when you need it- this is why we have friends and communities.  \n\n\nI hate the \"you can do it, you're so strong\" stuff.

Our purchasing agent told us he had to justify purchasing those supplies to our boss.\n\nWe have several employees over the age of 65, all of whom have asked to work from home at some point in the last three weeks. We have an existing supply of work cell phones and laptops equipped with all needed software, and our IT department had a plan in place before the virus for offsite/at-home work for anyone on extended medical leave. Our boss has denied all of their requests, because \u201cif we do it for you, we have to do it for everyone, and we don\u2019t have enough laptops and phones for that.\u201d Our IT department then sent a memo stating that we had enough money in the budget to purchase any technology needed for all employees to work from home (with numbers to back up the claim and a P.S. from accounting that the numbers were solid). That was sent a little over a week ago, and the boss hasn\u2019t responded.\n\nMy desk is within earshot of many of my boss\u2019s conversations. Yesterday, my boss sat down with our HR rep to discuss the emergency paid sick leave act.

(As a side note: the emergency paid sick leave act took effect April 1, but was enacted March 18. My boss had about 10 business days to prepare paperwork and policy, and opened up a dialogue with HR just yesterday.)\n\nMy boss has also repeatedly used the word \u201cstupid\u201d to describe measures our local and state governments have implemented in order to discourage assembling in groups. \n\nThere are other, smaller issues as well, but these are the most glaring concerns that we have. We\u2019ve discussed what we\u2019d like to collectively say/write to our boss in defense of our rights as employees, but feel our argument may fall a little flat in some areas.

Encourage everyone to become fanatics about washing their hands after touching any shared surfaces.\n\nThe next suggestion is more difficult. Can you and your co-workers agree on the priority of who should be working from home? For example, Ted\u2019s 65 and has asthma, and Joe is 37 and generally healthy, so Ted should get first priority. (I know it can strike every/anyone; that info does no good here.) If you can agree, call a meeting with the boss and propose, \u201cWe have enough IT equipment for X people to work from home. We collectively propose these people take advantage of that immediately as they are at the highest risk.\u201d Include a ranking IT person in the meeting to support your claim. IT could also tell the boss the number of people in your area or industry who are working remotely (\u201c85% of the industry is working remotely with no significant reduction in service.\u201d) If you want to take the additional step, also have a ranking finance person in the meeting and as the second item, have the finance person say, \u201cWe have enough money in the budget to purchase equipment for an additional Y number of people to WFH and recommend moving on this immediately.\u201d\n\nThe key will be to have everyone on the same page going into the meeting, and present the proposals in such a way that the boss can take credit for them.

You have until 7:00 AM to get your stuff and get out.\u201d They did this to a whole bunch more people and could not provide us, the IT support department, with a list of who all was going to be where. It took nearly a week an a half to get those people situated. We could have had them all ready to go in two days if upper management had just listened at the beginning. \n\nAs far as the rest of the employees, they flat out denied we had the capabilities to allow them to work from home. That was a lie. I pointed out to my superiors, who were making that claim, that it was a lie (more diplomatically than that of course). I got ignored. \n\nThen, this week we were informed during an impromptu video conference that we were all being called back into the office the next day. My department threw a justifiably huge fit.

Eventually that led to them making the wise choice to shut their stores.  In that recorded meeting, there was one store manager who said \"When are we going to put people over profit on this\", and another person said, can we at least stop taking trade ins?  People are gross and what they bring in is often filthy and full of germs.  Their response, while I cant remember the exact thing they said, was definitely not on the side of caring for their employees or their customers.  The negative press hurt them and they finally decided to close the stores, and it is yet to be known on if that will effect their brand later on  So I was thinking that maybe you could show some of that negative stuff (google it) to your boss.  It is kind of eye opening on how not to respond.\n\nAnother good thing to maybe show them is related to something Mark Cuban said a few weeks ago.

My mother also has struggled with alcoholic cycles. My husband was very sick and ended up passing away and his families alcoholism made the experience 1,000 times worse. We had a huge falling out and I\u2019ve instilled some strict boundaries so they could remain in my children\u2019s lives. \n\nOut of my four siblings, two of us don\u2019t drink at all.

Not anymore lol.\n\nAnyway, probably for the best.

I could drink like I was in my 20's again and not *feel* drunk.  I'd wake up, no hangover...but hours later it'd hit me like a ton of bricks.  So I dialed back - no more than 3 drinks...\n\nWhich still had me sick as a dog later the next day.  Even one drink threatened to make my next day rough.  So I stopped.\n\nWhat it did was realign my social life...I live in a town where everything involves alcohol, we have more bars per capita and more bars on one street than almost every city in the country.  Drinking culture in Wisconsin is no joke.\n\nSo my social circle decreased, COVID did a number there too.  Now that I'm off the SSRI, I just don't have the desire to go out and spend time in a noisy bar with people getting drunk.

I've reclaimed about 6\" of my belt this year, and might need to buy new dress pants again.\n\nThe meds I'm on the past 6 years affect how my body treats alcohol...  I can have 2 beer and be fine.  3 might as well be 6 (and fairly good odds of a hangover), 4 might as well be 8, and 5 gives me a 3 day hangover.\n\nWas out to a beer & billiards night last night.  2 pints, 2 cokes, and dry ribs over 3hrs.

Of course I'm not trying to drink like I did in those days.", "I think it's fine, but I've learned my limits much better and exactly what and how much of it I can drink and what the results will be the next day. Honestly the shitty sleep is the biggest deterrent especially since good sleep is not a given for me anymore.", "I didn't try drinking until I was in my 30s so I may have missed the window for alcohol not making me feel unwell.

I also liked any kind of Dionysian \"Break on Through to the Other Side\" experimentation and derangement of the senses. \n\nOnce I was clomping out of a party wearing imaginary shit-kicker boots and singing under my breath \"Am I EVIL? Yes, I FUckin' AMmmm!\" and I overheard some amused upperclassman observing to his buddy: \"Whoa! See that? That's it! That's the drunken swagger!\"\n\nThese days, I see drinking as not that fun and as a source of empty calories.  If I eat ANY kind of junk food or drink, it had better be a LOT of fun to justify me giving it a 99-year lease on belly property.

I can't piss money away on records, shows, or alcohol anymore.\n\nI have some decades-old bottles of tequila I should throw out because they are nasty and I'm never going to enjoy drinking them. \n\nRecently, I did actually buy some airplane bottles of cheap cinnamon-flavored bourbon with a devil cartoon on the label.

Started hating the feeling of dragging myself to bed with the room still spinning and feelings nauseated so I started cutting back then. It wasn't even the hangovers.\n\nIn my 30s I got really athletic and now in my 40s run or do other sports most days of the week and I'm a morning workout person. I can't drink most evenings or I end up getting poor sleep and am dehydrated in the morning so I've naturally cut back on drinking over the years.\n\nI'll enjoy a glass of wine or an Old Fashioned on the rare nights where I don't have to get up at 4am the next day but otherwise, meh. I'd rather waste my empty calories on chocolate.", "I had to lay off alcohol because of the medication I took. I was able to stop with the meds and after a few weeks I treated myself with a mojito.

Drinking is still great, but my hangovers are a bit more intense than they used to be. \n\nKnow your limits, know when to go home (especially during the week), and if the bar is lame or too loud, find a different bar.

She was very loved and will have quite a few people attending paying their respects, 75% are elderly and a couple people are on oxygen. \n\nMy brother (mid 40s) called me (late 30s) today and told me he has a fever, sick and tested positive for Covid but he\u2019s still coming (a 3 hour drive and get a hotel and test again) and will just double mask at the funeral if it\u2019s positive again (he did test positive again) I was kinda of in shock being he works in the medical field and of course concerned about his health. I spoke with my step father who was equally shocked those were his plans and of course concerned too about him too. So we called my brother and explained to him that it\u2019s best he doesn\u2019t attend to not possibly spread it. That it\u2019s probably best he attends the burial that\u2019s outside in the next few days to pay his respects. and to take care of himself to get well so he can make the burial. \n\nI called the funeral director and checked if a private viewing was an option and given how sick he is, it\u2019s not. My brother called too, and got the same answer. It\u2019s understandable. \n\nI sent my brother an empathic text message being I imagine this is hard on him and suggested to see if I could get it live streamed for him. He replied \u201cnever contact me again you F***in b**ch. I will never forgive you for keeping me from my mother\u2019s funeral\u201d  I was again shocked and didn\u2019t text him again per his request. \n\nI understand people grieve differently and so many emotions happen that are unique to the individual. Have I missed something? Isn\u2019t it common sense to not go to something like that if you\u2019re that sick especially with a raging  case of Covid. Have I missed something? \n\nIt\u2019s truly just sad, i know our mom wouldn\u2019t want her children not getting along on such a day. I\u2019m trying my best to not take it personal. But, at the same time he\u2019s also a grown man and I feel I shouldn\u2019t have to be explaining this to him, much less making phone calls to find alternative attendance for him.

It\u2019s up to him what he decides to after the suggestions given. I don\u2019t know the conversation he had with the funeral director, he got very upset after that.

Good move, and he should still obviously keep a safe distance from people.", "Very sorry for your loss. Personally...it sounds like your brother overreacted. This could be symptomatic of his grieving for yours (and his) mothers passing and also his stance on masking. I could see either/both of these things easily making a person enraged. Perhaps, with time, he will come around as a lot emotions can come out during this time.\n\nMy experience with funerals, having attended my mother's (pre-Covid), tells me that people are *very* emotional. I found my siblings and I having moments and I'm certain it was because of the *unexpectedness* of everything. I even found myself having bursts of intense feelings and quite a bit on my mind. Now that I look back on it-this was one of the most difficult things to control because I didn't (and still don't) know **exactly** how to feel about the entirety of who my mother was. \n\nOne of my regrets is having a drink after the burial with my family. We all had a few as a kind of social gathering thing, I guess. In hindsight, it would've been better to not do it because I had a small argument with a sibling. It made things weird for a moment and I definitely think it was the alcohol talking and the circumstances that brought us together. My family has had a very checkered past.

Title says it all. For clarification I am a guy.\n\nI live in the same metro area as my sister\u2019s family so I see my 16 YO nephew very frequently. I\u2019m horrified to have watched him grow up and take a turn toward frighteningly sexist and mysoginistic views. It came out in full force last night during dinner when he made several arguments/points and asked several questions we could not satisfactorily answer or address:\n\n* He couldn\u2019t have any sympathy for women who are 1) prostitutes who get assaulted, and 2) in relationships with men who assault them. He used that as evidence that women in general are weaker and inherently dependent on men. Relatedly, he kept asking why do women naturally gravitate toward men who are muscular and/or manipulative such as athletes and pickup artists?\n* He thought America was a stronger place before feminism/women entered the workplace; he even attributed that event/trend to wage stagnation and all the various problems we have faced since the 70s. The unspoken undertone is that women should be subservient to their husbands/sexual partners\n* He could also not understand why women dress the way they do if they don\u2019t want to get raped\n* He mentioned several times that women are themselves naturally more manipulative and/or less emotionally stable than men, and that they are physically weaker than men\n* He mentioned women are naturally stupider than men. Here I shot back and said that women are statistically more likely to both attend and complete college than men, but he responded by saying that college only evaluates obedience (e.g. completing assignments and taking tests) and not intelligence.\n\nWriting all this out, I\u2019m realizing how batshit it all is and how no reasonable person could possibly come to any of these conclusions. It is causing his family and I so much anguish. Nevertheless I want to be better mentally equipped next time we have this argument because this is an insanely dangerous mentality that will get him and others in trouble and will prevent him from getting close to many people. I think he is quite sharp, and I think having a very clear set of facts will at least plant a seed that will hopefully get him from digging himself further into this hole.

He needs to hear womens' side of things, and he needs a man to point it out to him. \n\nMost importantly, he needs to understand where his feelings about women are coming from, and how to handle them in a productive manner.\n\nLastly I do want to point out that if he has a male role model for example a misogynist of a father that you might need to handle that one-on-one as well.

I didn't try to draw him into a drawn out debate. There's a lot of truth in the statement, \"you can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into\". I just put pressure, made sure my distaste towards these ideas was well known and pointed out how those ideas were going to just hurt the people around him and hurt any chances he had at forming normal relationships.\n\nThe other angle was to help him address the other issues in his life leading to his social isolation and depression. I helped him learn to be himself again instead of trying so hard to fit in that it was stressing him out. I was very encouraging and supportive whenever he got into a gym regimen. I helped him reform his social life, start meeting people and making friends again.\n\nOverall, I was very supportive of the positive in his life, empathetic to his struggles, and made clear that proto-incel views disgusted me, and my opinion that they'd only hurt everyone.\n\nThankfully I was there before his radicalization had gone too far, and already had a preexisting relationship of respect.

They either broke them off when the women wanted commitment or their standards were too high (expected the girl to be a 10 when they are barely 7's and expected to be treated great by these girls when they did not treat the girls that well).\n\nYou'd think16 yo guys would want to be physical with girls.

Other cultures do better at encouraging young people of opposite sexes to sit at the table together, take dancing classes, stuff like that.  Today there are so many options for sexuality that I wonder if young people are just frozen with fear.\n\nA lot of these statements he's making are excuses to not have to grow up, learn about the opposite sex/explore his own sexuality.

Just because there were more playstations, doesn't meant that was was the CAUSE of the decline of teen violence).

Nowadays I'm still into a lot of that stuff but you wouldn't really know to look at me and I'm not playing in bands or anything.\n\nMy closest buddy- Jimmy- from that group moved to the coast with another friend, Scott. I hardly ever see them cause my job has me out of town a lot and doesn't really have a schedule all the time. Thing is when I do have a schedule they often come to town when they know I'll be working. Recently Jimmy sent me a drunken message about how he misses us being close and how we never hang but I'm trying to get my life together and my job is unusual in that I kind of can't just \"take some days off\" and he doesn't really make an effort to work around that \n\nThing is I was a fuckup for a long time. Undiagnosed ADHD and sleep issues made it hard for me to excel at my job, so I was always scrambling even though I have a good-paying trade ticket. Went through my shit with women too, partly for the same reasons, but also because i was always a bit lonely and kind of made bad choices in partners for awhile, sort of just any port in a storm. But I have a loyal, generous and kind fianc\u00e9e now, and I'm kicking ass at work with a company that's giving me all kinds of opportunities and interesting projects. Hell, I was off due to injury for awhile and the minute I was healed they started throwing even more cool shit at me to do. In 2 years I've done a wider and more interesting variety of jobs than I did in ten with my old company, and I'm making a lot more money (partly due to never having stretches with no work). And hell, I would even say I *like* my job these days whereas I was looking for a way out before.\n\nThrough all that, my friend Dave got a trade of his own, got shacked up with a woman, bought a house 13 years ago, had kids, just always had it together. When I split from my ex years and years ago I rented a room in his basement for awhile. Recently he's split up with that woman, had to buy a second house to live in nearby to make it easy on the kids, so money's tight, I've been floating him when we can hang out because that's what you do. Shit's tough buy a guy a beer. Dave's had the same work schedule for five years and Jimmy and Scott always make sure they visit when he's free.\n\nSo they came out for a big music thing this weekend and as usual up until last minute I wasn't even sure if I'd be working or not but I made it. It's been four years since I saw them, my shit is together, I'm doing better right now than I probably ever have, I'm excited about what I'm doing, so I'm telling them about it. \n\nDave is at the other end of the table, not even a part of the conversation and out of nowhere yells \"Shut up about work, nobody gives a fuck about (thing I work with).\" This is within minutes of me showing up. So I told him to fuck off, that I don't get why he'd be a dick when I'm finally able to be happy and excited about my life. But y'know, it shut me down and stopped me talking. No one- Not Jimmy or Scott or anyone else- said anything about it, no one said \"we were interested, go on\" everyone just kinda went on with their night. I've had terrible anxiety for years, where your brain is always telling you \"these people find you annoying, no one cares about this story, these people talk shit when you're not here\" and it felt like after years of trying to quiet that voice it turned out to actually be right.\n\nSo I hung out still but basically avoided the people I went there to see, watched some bands I didn't care about and honestly kinda stewed on it.\n\nI realised that I can't think of a time Dave has ever said a kind thing. If you got a new shirt he'd say it looks stupid, if you got a haircut he'd say it looks like some character from tv that sucks, everyone writes it off as busting balls and friends do that but like I say he's *never* said a nice thing. \n\nSo everyone went on with their night and I got pissed and they told me to get over it, but when I said that not one of them stood up for me, they all just waved it off and they said they \"don't wanna pick sides\" but that's exactly what they had already done.\n\nI basically told them all to go to hell. I realised none of them have ever been particularly *nice* and they certainly haven't made any effort to be nice to my fianc\u00e9e. At my age, your friends should at least be nice. I have friends that hear I'm doing well and say \"fuck yeah glad to hear it you deserve it\" and these guys I think- Dave in particular- Are mostly annoyed that they can't look to me and feel better about themselves.\n\nI'm just trying to vent here I guess.

The three of us really struggled when we were younger, but I got my shit together and they did not. One of them blew up at me that we aren't as good friends as I thought, and that my partner makes him awkward and he doesn't like coming over. The other friend just used me as a place to vent about her life and review her job applications.

To me it sounds that perhaps, you might have prioritized your job more than your friends. Which is fine, there is nothing wrong with that. But at least be honest with yourself about it. I know if I hadn't seen *my* old friends in 4 years and they came to my town to see me, I would make sure to clear my schedule for a night to spend time with them.\n\nNow, after not being able to commit to a night out with your friends who you had not seen in years and who came all the way from another town to see you, you finally manage to make it at the last minute.

We were both part of a music subcluture and there was a point were I went back to school, got my ADHD diagnosed and medicated, and just wanted more out of life than hanging out in clubs. He was on the wrong side of 45 and the way he was desperately holding on to that lifestyle just made him unattractive to me. That was one of several things that contributed to the end of the marriage.\n\nThe more recent event was with a friend I\u2019ve known for 25 years. It got to the point where she was always getting offended by something I would say. She didn\u2019t want anyone to know her real age so she would get mad, like seriously angry, if I mentioned something like \u201cOh remember that one party in 2001\u2026\u201d I was as always walking on eggshells wondering when she was going to get pissed about something. \n\nThen a few years ago I decided to grow out my natural grey hair, which most people absolutely love and have nothing but nice things to say about.

I was also still recovering from a recent hip surgery and happened to be in a lot of pain that night so I was having a hard time walking around but every I would reminder her about this she would just start talking about herself. \n\nThe final straw was the last time tried having an intelligent conversation with her about a current event and she went on this whole tirade about some how some guy she was hooking up with was seeing someone else and how she\u2019s going to kick this girls ass and how every guy is an asshole.

I have become much more stable, unstable people who can\u2019t get their shit together are not people I really want around anymore.

These places have great benefits and tons of extracurricular activities. They're really marketed to college kids. In my experience, you can expect to make 10 to 15k less in any position in a startup.\n\nIf it's a tech startup, there's this awesome thing a lot of them are doing where they give you extra time on the clock to learn new skills that would help you move to a different area of the company or do your job better. This makes it worth taking the pay cut. I worked for a 3D printing company and was able to learn tons of other skills around 3D modeling and printing. You could shadow people in the company if you wanted to move into a different department. And most of them have tuition reimbursement programs.\n\nEdit: also it is absolutely imperative you be willing to stretch the boundaries of what encompasses your job at startups. I've been the entire customer success department, while also helping with first rounds of hiring interviews, editing grant proposals, and trying to figure out if we're even doing the grants right despite the fact that I had no grant writing experience whatsoever.

Here\u2019s a poem called Rainbow bridge that helped me when my dog passed. \n\nJust this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.\nWhen an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.\n\nAll the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.\n\nThey all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.\n\nYou have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.\n\nThen you cross Rainbow Bridge together....", "I'm so sorry!

Punctuated by sobs and silences, our conversation lasted nearly an hour. \"I really don't know what to do,\" Jack said. \"My friends say I should go to Penn or Cornell for chemo. My girlfriend says I should try alternative medicine, maybe something homeopathic. I can't bear to think of it. When do you put a dog down? How do you decide? I can't bear to lose him, but I don't want him to suffer.\"\n\nWe spoke three or four times over the next couple of weeks, Jack agonizing over the many options he was hearing about. The vet had urged him to euthanize the dog before Schuyler's condition worsened, but Jack had clearly decided against that. He was apparently going to put the dog down \"when he was ready,\" and thought he wasn't ready yet. One evening, he said he'd talked to a friend and dog lover who'd told him that Schuyler would tell him when it was time to go, that Jack should watch and listen to the dog for cues. He asked if I thought this was the right course.\n\n[Continue Article ](../My%20Download%20Files/When%20Should%20You%20Put%20Your%20Dog%20Down%20%20-%20How%20to%20make%20a%20decision%20you%20never%20want%20to%20make.%20By%20Jon%20Katz.html#ContinueArticle)\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I couldn't quite say what I was thinking. Each decision about the death of a dog is personal and different, dependent on context and circumstances. But if I had told him what I was thinking, it would have been this: Dogs are voiceless. They can't tell us when it's time to die, even if they were capable of such abstract thought. That's something we have to decide for them, wielding our love, compassion, and common sense as best we can. \n\nI didn't look to my wonderful yellow Labs to tell me when it was time for them to go, one diagnosed with congestive heart failure, the other with colon cancer. The responsibility and decision, it seemed to me, was mine, not theirs. I put them down before they endured any prolonged suffering\u2014my own choice, not a recommendation for others.\n\nIn the context of the most personal decision any dog owner ever makes, there are few universal truths. Jack ended up keeping Schuyler alive for two months, until the dog's jaw had swollen to grapefruit size. When he called me again, I told him it seemed time, and he put the dog to sleep. Later, he called this the most wrenching period of his life, so painful he'd decided never to get another dog. I told him that was a shame.\n\nIt is the nature of dogs to live much shorter lives than ours\u2014just eight years, on average\u2014and it has always been my belief that to love and own a dog is to understand and accept that along with loyalty, love, and devotion come the ever-present specters of grief and loss. This is as integral a part of the dog-loving experience as going for walks.\n\nThere's no Idiot's Guide for this question, no handbook. The many points of view are strongly held. One vet I know says a dog should be euthanized \"when it can no longer live the life of a dog\u2014and only the owner knows when that really is.\" A breeder says she puts her dogs down when \"their suffering exceeds their ability to take pleasure in life.\" A trainer I respect believes her dog should live as long as it can eat.\n\nAnother friend and dog lover says she always knows when it's time: \"when the soul goes out of their eyes.\"\n\nI'm not among those who believe dogs have souls, but I know what she means. There is a certain visceral \"dogness\" about dogs, an interest in people, food, squirrels, passing trucks\u2014whatever\u2014that's part of their individual spirits. When that disappears, it does seem the \"soul\" of the dog is gone.\n\nBut I know other owners\u2014a growing number, according to vets\u2014who fight to keep their dogs alive as long as possible, at all costs.\n\nResearching my last book, I visited an emergency-care clinic that had six dogs on respirators at a cost of nearly a $1,000 per week per dog.\n\nTheir owners, the vets said, simply could not bear to lose them. In the context of America's growing love affair with dogs\u2014there are nearly 70 million owned dogs in the United States and nearly 10 million more in shelters\u2014this seems to me a travesty, not only for the dogs but for the humans who've lost sight of the fact that these amazing creatures are animals.\n\nIncreasingly, we've come to see our dogs as human, childlike members of our families, companions that sometimes provide us with more emotional support than friends or spouses, more satisfaction than work, more support than we can find elsewhere. As a result, people are increasingly devastated by the loss of their dogs, more uncertain about how and when to put them down, more inclined to spend thousands of dollars on surgery, alternative cures, foods, and treatments that might prolong their lives.\n\nAs the owner of three dogs, I spend more than I can truly afford to keep them healthy and vigorous. But as my conversations with Jack reminded me, they are not people. Their lives and deaths ought not be conflated or confused with human losses.\n\nTo love dogs is to know death and to accept that there's never a time we are more morally obliged to speak for them than when they face the end of their lives.\n\n*Jon Katz is the author of* [The New Work of Dogs: Tending to Love, Life and Family](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375508147/qid=1078355935/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-2908938-6996658?v=glance&n=507846)*.

Users communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called \"servers\"\n\nThis is simultaneously completely accurate (I have no reason to doubt) but also entirely unhelpful. Is there an explanation out there written by someone over 20 that isn't just Discord marketing material? Ideally something that would answer the \"why\" as much as the \"what\".\n\nI have created an account on Discord and joined a few channels. I guess I understand that it is a place where people with similar interests go to discuss things. But I feel like I hit a mental block after that. To me, it just looks like IRC, or any other live chat service - \u00e0 la AOL rooms, Reddit Live, etc. But based on its apparent popularity, Discord is doing something better than these myriad other existing chat services. So what makes Discord different? Why the sudden explosion in popularity? How should I be using Discord to prove that I \"get it\" (particularly, in a way that differentiates it from any other chat service)?\n\nBonus question, why did they choose the term \"servers\"? Could they have chosen a more confusing terminology? When I first encountered that phrase, I honestly thought people were spinning up AWS instances or something.\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the responses. This question got a lot more interest than I expected. I think you've managed to answer my question. Basically, Discord is a lot like older chat solutions but improved in a number of important ways - lower barrier of entry, addition of video and voice, persistent messages, integration with other services, better emojis, etc. Discord also enables a bunch of interesting use-cases that no other platform does as well such as spontaneous group video/voice chats, highly curated content, and easily spun-up private spaces. It seems that Discord's explosive popularity is due to its initial enthusiastic adoption in gamer communities. It seems to be filling a real-time gap left by message-board services like Reddit that IRC never quite filled.", ["It\u2019s just modern day IRC with video.", "This should be a sub in contrast to ELI5... ELI60", "Very easy community building. Massive amount of free functionality.  Easily searchable chat archives. Super easy way to stream what you're doing or engage with multiple people on a webcam at once. **REALLY GOOD** voice detection / filtering tech (won't pick up your crunchy chip chewing and send it to your friends). \n\nFurther to that, it integrates with the \"new world of emojis\" where artists can create their own emojis for use in internet communities, which is prized by the art communities and the streamer communities.\n\nIt's really just an alternate evolution of social media, specifically around user-moderated communities. Very like reddit, but meant to be used more in real time than as a message board.", "> So what makes Discord different?\n\nCompared to IRC:\n\n* You don't have to remain online or run a BNC/daemon or anything to see chat history from when you were offline.  You can see it all, even chat from before you joined a server/channel (I think).\n* More centralized: no dealing with server addresses / different IRC networks, network splits etc.\n* Likewise no fucking around with nickserv bot commands etc to retain your nick\n* You can edit + delete messages you wrote\n* Partial markdown support\n* Easier to understand for less technical people overall... which means more users overall, aka \"the network effect\"\n* Built in voice/video chat\n* Well supported clients for all of: web browser + electron desktop apps + phone apps\n* Them controlling both the servers/protocol + clients means you can have more features, which reliably work for all users too\n\n...all these can be said for Slack too.  \n\nI'm a long time IRC user... used it since the mid 90s, wrote bots etc, was even l33t enough to read bitchx.doc...\n\nBut I prefer Slack + Discord now for the reasons above.  IRC is kinda annoying to use in comparison now, especially when you want to show source code to other users.  \n\nAnd I also have a little bit of paranoia about accidently pasting things into IRC, now that I'm used to being able to delete + edit on the newer systems.\n\nThese days, really the only remaining pro to IRC is that it's more \"free\", due to not being centralized.  But for me personally, all the other benefits of slack/discord outweigh that.  \n\nIf I was going to start my own thing that I wanted to fully control/self-host, I'd perhaps consider Mattermost or Rocket.chat or something... but in all likelihood I'd just accept that Slack/Discord have the lowest barrier to entry for users, therefore they're the more pragmatic options if you want the most users actually using it.\n\n> Bonus question, why did they choose the term \"servers\"?\n\nYeah it's dumb.  Something like \"Organization\" would have been better.", ">To me, it just looks like IRC, or any other live chat service - \u00e0 la AOL rooms, Reddit Live, etc. But based on its apparent popularity, Discord is doing something better than these myriad other existing chat services.\n\nIt's not really different, but those things were technically dated and not very assessable via phones etc. There was a gap in the modern social media landscape for a centralized hub for chatroom communities, and Discord happened to be the one to fill it.", "Re: adoption, I think it's the minimal barrier to entry. If I want to get you into my Discord server, I send you a link, and that's it. You don't need anything other than your browser. You don't even need to make an account ahead of time. Network effects do the rest of the work in terms of popularity.", "Personally I think discord is very similar to old chat services and VOIP, I'm not that old, but I feel like it's much more mainstream now as opposed to a decade ago.\n\nI also think it shines the most when you have groups of friends in a private server.

Though there is the one client, Discord, instead of various IRC-like variant programmes we used to use, and you can have it on your phone and computer and tablet. We used to be invited to particular channels on various servers, some private, and admins and emotes etc. and it's the same - the various rooms on a server are like channels. And some have voice / video options rather than just text chat. Sometimes friends just hang out there, sometimes they're used for specific gatherings or to talk about a TV show. A friend uses it for an art course. Emojis are prettier than 90s smilies.\n\nI learnt about Internet chat in the mid 90s when we just had conf and ytalk and spent years on Trillian with AIM and ICQ; now I have various IM apps - it's all the same really, just more complex and needs faster computers :)", "Remember IRC?\n\nImagine if IRC and zoom had a bastard love child and the kids thought they invented it.

You can find all kinds of communities there that find use in a persistent text chat with the option to have voice chats and video sharing. Though I am mostly on gaming related servers, I also am on ones for an artist I support on Patreon, Twitch streamers of course, Reddit's /r/RandomActsofCards community has a very active server I'm on, too, my toy collector community has a Discord, my group of friends to play P&P with (online due to Covid), Eurovision - basically, lots of interests that have nothing to do with gaming have communities there.\n\nIt can easily get overwhelming when you join multiple servers, so I mute those that I don't check that often.

I had a Prairie Home Companion t-shirt in high school in the early 1980s. So the change for us has really been more about the delivery method (i.e. digital vs. FM) rather than content.

And warehouses were rough on electronics, so instead of paying $19.95 for a cassette walkman every 4-6 weeks until it broke, I just bought $3.99 AM\\FM radios instead. \n\nI loved Atlanta's two main college stations - WRAS (Georgia State) and WREK (Georgia Tech), but it seemed like any time I tuned in it was in the middle of a 6 hour Tibetan rap show. Commercial stations were complete crap - 99x, then the city's alternative station, played the same 19 songs *every single day*. So talk radio it was, if only because it was *different* every day.\n\nMostly. I actually found an AM *classical* station. It seems that some younger rich guy bought a small AM station in hopes of reselling the FCC license.

They're really not, though. \n\nLook at the weird word art thing people decorate their homes with. No offense to those who do, but why? It's all reminders to be happy and grateful and all full of joy and laughter 24/7. It's like we're trying to convince ourselves to only feel that part of the full spectrum of human emotions, and we can't do that. And I've never known a truly happy, well adjusted person who had those. (Not that there aren't any. I just haven't known any.)\n\nIt is normal and healthy to feel bored, lonely, unfulfilled, sad, angry, nostalgic, despondent, melancholic, scared, bitter, and any number of other things in addition to happy, grateful, and even content. If you were only capable of emotions on the 'happy' end of the spectrum, that'd seem kind of hollow, I'd think. Only guessing here, because I have no personal experience, but I imagine it'd get boring after a while. \n\nI get pleasure of a sort from sad songs and spooky stories and dismal movies. They aren't happy things, but they're human experiences that fulfill me in some way. I used to have a serious problem with insomnia, but it's been years since I've had an episode, and this weird part of me misses that kind of lonely, almost degenerate feeling you get when all the normal people are asleep. (As a grownup, I'll add that it was even more pronounced back when TV and radio went off the air and you'd find weird little low power radio stations playing strange music and a handful of public access shows and cult movies that only insomniacs knew about. \n\nHappiness is great in moderation, but I think a lot of other things can be too. \n\nThat's why I strive for contentment as a baseline.

I was in this group too.\n\nI learned some new words and i revised my attitude and i feel better about my life and i understand it much better now. The words i learned are gratitude, serenity, honesty to name a few and i realized that i had not really changed what i thought happiness was since i was a child even though almost everything else in my life had changed.\n\nI also realize that the longer i am alive the more forces there are that try to make me miserable. when i was a child simple things could make me happy but after experiencing all of them, where do i go? do i keep looking for bigger and better thrills? some people do. \n\nI think the happiness i chased was too lofty and too elusive and even when i thought i had found it one thing wrong and it could turn disappointing quickly. So instead i was taught the much more plentiful and durable gratitude. To be grateful for food, my health, a shelter, friends, a job, freedom, etc, not deliriously happy but to be aware that many people on this planet do not have these things and they are not guaranteed.\n\nIs the gratitude i feel for these things different from the joy of watching a fantastic movie, a day at a theme park, seeing a loved one after a long time apart? Yes, of course, but if i start my day with gratitude i am much more likely to find joy and \"happiness\" in my day, sometimes in places i wouldn't expect it.\n\nThe more time a human lives, the more hurts we endure, disappointments, guilt for bad actions, anger, resentments, the more negativity we see in the world, the more people get sick and die around us, etc.....if we are not very good at handling these things they can pile up and easily cripple our enjoyment of life, we accumulate \"baggage\" as many people call it. If you don't know how to deal with it this stuff can pile up quickly.\n\nYes, good stuff happens too but for people like me the bad stuff has a way of hanging around a lot longer than the good unfortunately, so i had to learn ways to deal with it so i could see the good stuff in life again.", "Midlife ennui is real. \u201cContent and comfortable\u201d is me most of the time.

We hiked to the top of the island, had a bbq, and kayaked back in the dark.

I'm not a Biden fan, but my city went nuts when he was announced as the winner, and people were cheering and driving around hanging out of their windows.  While I feel it was a bit misguided, I feel like we're all missing a sense of community and wonder (Burning Man participants often talk about the amazing experiences they have, due to all of the wonders that are created, and people they had an experience with).  Our malls all look and feel the same, small unique places are being replaced by local big box stores, music and media are no longer something you really experience as much as just consume, and you can literally see everything in the world online now (so where is the personal experience or surprise).  I went on Dead Tour in 95, and it was filled with so many crazy experiences and memories...and I just don't know if we're all living in the same world anymore.\n\nI honestly believe the internet has become a substitution for people's interactions with one another, or even for exploring our world.

Content is coasting, and yes it can be good but there is a numbness to it for me.\n\nLots of commentary in this thread about how people's expectations is that they should be on a high all the time, and that life isn't like that. While there is truth in that, it doesn't sound to me like you have unrealistic expectations. Sounds to me like you're mildly depressed - numb, not taking any joy in things that used to appeal, feeling down. *Anhedonia* would be the technical term I think.\n\nGood news is that depression is very treatable, especially when its not too severe. Get some therapy. \n\nIts also notable that you don't mention friends or family in your post - you speak about hobbies, a \"companion\", shopping, going out. For most people close relationships are the primary source of happiness. Could just be the way you phrased things of course, but if not: Are your close relationships in good shape? How do you want that to change?\n\nWhich brings me on to my final point. It seems to me that, in adulthood, happiness (or contentment, or meaning, or satisfaction or whatever we're calling it) is generated largely making a contribution that others appreciate. Its doesn't have much to do with what you get, once you're earning enough to eliminate significant financial stress. \n\nI'm not talking quitting your job and joining the peace corps.

I remember thinking to myself: \u201cremember this because it might be the last time he does it.\u201d Or, another example, this past winter my favorite time of day was in the evenings after dinner when my kids and husband and I would be sitting in the living room by the fire reading, doing homework, petting the dog, or just quietly talking and laughing. I remember realizing that I was at perfect peace and happiness in those moments and that I\u2019m so lucky to have these people and this sweet animal in my life. I\u2019d get a little shiver of happiness. It\u2019s the little things like that, in my experience. You might have to train yourself to notice them but they\u2019re there if you do.\n\nSince you mentioned hobbies, do you do anything physical that takes you outside of yourself? We took up downhill skiing as a family a few years ago. One of the reasons why I enjoy it so much is that I find that I have to really concentrate hard on challenging runs so I don\u2019t fall and break something (lol). It\u2019s good though because it\u2019s one of the few times in my life that I\u2019m really \u201cin the zone\u201d with my mind shut off, so to speak, from its usual thoughts/worries/concerns. It\u2019s exciting when you get into a hood groove and your body takes over and is operating on muscle memory and the beautiful scenery is whirring past. Then I make it to the bottom and I\u2019m pleasantly proud of myself and breathing hard. It feels really good."]], "leu2ag": ["As you get older do you realize there's just something you're never going to be able to do?", "For me, it's visiting Hawaii.  \n\nSince I was a teenager I've wanted to visit Hawaii.

I was like, *those bastards!*\n\nThe apartment before that, it got so the landlords would just rent to anyone with enough of a deposit, no screening process  because people literally didn't know how to behave.

Turns out that when her movers put her stuff into the unit, they crammed it in way too tightly (she really should have gotten a slightly bigger unit, but hey, if it fits, right?). Anyway, it took the two of us almost 45 minutes to wiggle and yank some boxes out to give me enough room to crawl under the door and figure out that a really heavy box had fallen against the top of the door. Finally got that out of the way and got the door fully open.\n\nAnyway, while we were getting this whole situation sorted, we got to talking, as you do, and it quickly became joking and bantering and laughing about what a pain in the ass this damn door was, and I was totally enjoying talking with her.

We started chatting again, and I just decided, to hell with professionalism - she's moving out in a couple of days anyway, so what do I have to lose? I said that I'd really enjoyed talking to her, and asked if she'd like to go to dinner sometime, if I wasn't being inappropriate by asking.\n\nThere was a pause for a few seconds, and I almost started thinking that I'd offended or scared her.

She looked young and beautiful, her hair flowing down. It was so pleasant to sit there and talk to her as if she had never died. When I woke up it was about two in the morning, and I felt very strongly that I had never lost my mother. The impression that my mother was still with me was very clear.

She was the moonlight caressing me as she had done so often, very tender, very sweet... wonderful! Each time my feet touched the earth I knew my mother was there with me. I knew this body was not mine but a living continuation of my mother and my father and my grandparents and great-grandparents. Of all my ancestors. Those feet that I saw as \"my\" feet were actually \"our\" feet. Together my mother and I were leaving footprints in the damp soil.\n\nFrom that moment on, the idea that I had lost my mother no longer existed.

The majority of my Christmases are now as a card-carrying member of the gift-giving club, given I'm on the cusp of middle age, so of course it's going to seem excessive when kids are getting mountains of presents. I think we're in the same boat here. \n\nOccasionally, I revisit the old VHS cassettes of my childhood, including Christmas morning. \n\nWhen it was my turn I got Legos of all sorts, games, sweaters and socks, and a dozen other things, and that was just from my parents and Santa. You couldn't even see the floor for all the gifts and torn wrapping paper, and it's not because my family was at all wealthy, it's because my parents derived great joy from giving all of these wonderful gifts to me, things I would enjoy for years to come and, in some part of my developing brain, would register that these each were little avatars of their recognition of things that made me happy and their love for me. \n\nDevelopmentally, it's tricky to teach the joy of giving to younger tykes. It's a concept of understanding long-term emotional consequences derived experientially from the gift and the meta-level understanding that the thoughtfulness of a gift is a symbol of your empathetic and sympathetic connection and understanding of the needs and wants of loved ones. It's easier for kids to understand that when they're the ones on the gift-receiving end, in fact I'd argue that plants the seed for them later recognizing the deeper meaning of the gifts and eventually wanting to give that feeling to others. \n\nCertainly, for me, the most important gifts I ever received taught me just how meaningful it is to get a truly thoughtful gift from a loved one, and now I'm chasing that dragon from the other end. This year, I planned for months to find just the right gifts for the people I care about the most. My step dad has wanted a sous vide for years now, but I think he held off on getting it for himself because a lot of the rest of the family has gone plant-based, so me (a plant-based person) getting it for him was like permission to indulge himself. My mom, someone who is perpetually cold, has been complaining about not being able to hug my brother and I all year, so I got her a really nice weighted blanket and told her it's a hug from my brother and I until we're all vaccinated. My brother and his girlfriend, both frontline healthcare workers, got just tons of homemade frozen and pantry-stable food from me so they can just throw something homemade in the oven or on the stovetop when they get home exhausted. (yes, I'm engaging in a little humblebragging about my gift-giving this year, but it is in support of my thesis)\n\nNot only did the excessive thoughtful gifts of my youth not spoil me, they eventually taught me the value of giving. The joy I got from my Christmases as a child are now being multiplied in my adulthood back to my loved ones. \n\nAs an aside, TIL people still use Skype.", "So why did you buy all of the gifts?

A new toy gets a lot more play and attention when it is the ONLY new toy. You can explain to the kids that excess is fun for a few minutes, but that we can get overwhelmed by all the choices and some new toys can get ignored and not appreciated--and by spreading things out, each toy gets a turn in the spotlight.

I saw your segment on ghosting just now, and I wanted to add my two cents.\n\n>I understand that the segment was intended to be quasi-humorous, but there are some real-world factors to take into consideration. It's easy to dismiss this as a \"trend\" or as another \"millennial\" failure to launch, but I would advise that businesses do so at their own peril.\n\n>What managers and your reporter refers to as \"ghosting\" is nothing more than a reflection of being an under-40 person in the workplace. Aside from the hiring process where applications fall into the HR black hole (ghosting), hiring managers who fail to even read the first few lines of a resume and seem to have no idea why you're at the table in front of them (ghosting), and two or three hours-long loop interviews with no followup (ghosting), after hire anyone can be let go at any time for no reason in at-will states (ghosting), downsized (ghosting), or have their benefits reduced without explanation or compensation (ghosting). And no, an automated email response doesn't count.\n\n>The lesson of the 2008 financial crisis is that there are no rewards for loyalty. Performance doesn't matter; qualifications don't matter; hard work and long hours by salaried employees don't matter; playing by the rules doesn't matter; employers can and will discard you for capricious and often contradictory reasons. More often than not, employees are met with radio silence.\n\n>If companies can dish it out, then they have no room to complain when they have to take a very small part of the same treatment. Cry me a river. You've taught at least two generations of potential employees that this behavior is acceptable. \n\n>They normalized this behavior starting in the '80s, and an improvement in workplace culture can start with them.\n\n>Anyway, thanks for reading this.

I started a new job last year, the application process was depressing, lots of ghosting and even the actual hiring process was traumatic (was offered the job on the spot by the hiring manager, but it took HR almost a month before they took 5 min to offically call and offer me the job), but then again the hiring process for my job previous to that was traumatic too (HR acted like I was rude to ask them to put the offer in writing, not to mention an extremely delayed and drawn out timeline,and then them thinking it was ok for me not to give my previous employer 2 weeks notice, who I left on good terms with and had zero intention of burning bridges with them), basically a LOT of dysfunction and poor communication on HR's side of things.  Hiring managers are not at fault, bc they are desperate, been on that side before and HR seems almost to be the enemy of both hiring managers AND applicants, but it seems like HR really takes their sweet time just to be jerks, sometimes.  If the hiring manager and the fact that I already knew my coworker that I was going to be working with, didn't personally PULL me through the process with HR (they would tell me if I hadn't heard by HR by x day to call them and they'd basically bug HR, this happened 4x in a span of 2 months and I was really conservative with giving HR extra time from what I was told by my manager to be and coworker on when to bug them to bug HR), I don't know how anyone who doesn't KNOW people already inside the organization do it, bc HR seemed determined to NOT do their jobs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "I once had two phone interviews, two case interviews (1.5 hours each), and an in person interview that was several hours long with 5 interviewers.

My brother struggled with lifelong depression and alcohol addiction - both low dopamine things too. I myself was addicted to cigarettes for most of my adult life and have had bouts of depression - also low dopamine things. I now take Dopaboost and Mucuna Dopa supplements (both available over the counter in a lot of countries), and they really help me. I've been taking them for a few years now, and only positive effects.\n\nAlso - and this might seem controversial to some - there are a LOT of great studies showing that magic mushrooms can work as a 'reset' for the brain and can help people completely change their negative thought patterns after even one session. In the studies they're typically used alongside therapy for the best results, and you can do this legally in the Netherlands (with magic truffles), also in Jamaica with LSD. Obviously magic mushrooms are illegal in many countries still, so be aware of the risks (physical and legal) if you do explore this path. There are lots of great resources online that will help you research this for yourself, and it's strongly recommended to take them with a 'trip sitter' (literally someone you really trust who can sit with you for up to 12 hours while you trip).

Like creating art or writing or working on meditating or if you are spiritual then do that. My point is to distract yourself each day with something , try physical activity, walking or hiking.

I did not find being on a beautiful island helpful, I think it made me more depressed but if that works for you that is great. For me, when I was deeply depressed and I could not do anything at all I just walked near some nice views near where I lived and went on easy hiking trails because pine trees make a soothing sound and are actually very healing.

Covid not only worked on destroying my lungs, but caused a cascade of secondary infections in my body because my immune system was so overtaxed that it just couldn\u2019t really fight anything off fully. As a result, I was hospitalized for 2 months, half of that in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator. Because I had been on the ventilator so long, it was necessary to have a tracheostomy in order to stay on it. After finally being released from the hospital, I was on supplemental oxygen for an additional 6 months. The last few weeks of my hospitalization was in rehab to strengthen enough to walk and feed myself.

She lived with us since 2014. When we cleaned out her MIL Suite attached to our house, we were left with containers upon containers of shit just thrown together that we didn't have the brainpower to organize at that time. \"I'll get to that later\". Well, those boxes are taking up 40 sq ft of space in your basement, and \"Later\" is looking a lot more like \"Soon\".\n\nIt's silly to jump into it without a plan. So I made you a plan. I developed your method. You have one less thing to think about now in this emotionally taxing project. Get your coffee, and read through this guide. You're going to freakin' CONQUER this. Let's make sense out of that chaos.\n\nHere we go!\n\n**Determining the Scope**\n\nTake a gander at your stack of bins and boxes. Take out each bin and rustle through it. Focus on identifying WHAT you\u2019re going to be working with.\n\nExample: For my Gran, we had notes, paperwork, photographs, household items, \u201cmemories\u201d (more on that later), and more fucking paperwork.\n\n**Number Your Containers**\n\nThis will save your ass later and help keep you organized. Number EACH box and tub. Physically. Write on those things with a thick ass sharpie \u201cTub\u201d or \u201cBox\u201d and then a number. It doesn\u2019t matter where the box came from. It doesn\u2019t matter what order they\u2019re in. Just as long as you establish inventory, you\u2019ll be grand.\n\nExample: I have Tub #1\u2014Tub #5 and Box #1\u2014Box #6\n\n**Isolate One Box & Make Room**\n\nTake out a container from the collection. Place it in a comfortable spot where you have room to move around. You may be getting up and moving from place to place, so make sure your room is clean and clear of obstacles. A clean room is a must. Put ALL the other containers in a separate area away from your organization room. Trust me. If you look at it, it will only intimidate you.\n\n**Establishing Categories**\n\nYou know the term \u201cWhen organizing, never touch anything twice\u201d? That\u2019s bullshit in this kind of project. We are taking this rollercoaster in steps. The purpose of, what I call \u201cRound 1\u201d, is to separate trash from the important stuff, and put \u2018like with like\u2019.\n\nYou\u2019re going to make an area, preferably with another big empty container, for each category. Here are the categories that WILL MOSTLY encompass everything you\u2019re bound to find in the hoard of miscellaneous small belongings thrown together at the end of a clear out.\n\nMemories\n\nPhotographs\n\nPaperwork\n\nPaper Memories\n\n\u201cI have no idea\u201d\n\nTrash\n\nLet me go over each category.\n\n\"Photographs\". Every photograph you can imagine. Even the printed ones. Not the ones in frames. If you want to be really progressive, keep the polaroids SEPERATE from anything else. The two types of chemicals used in the processing of the types of film degrades both of them. Portraits, cat pictures, garden pictures, the literal only picture of your great grandfather. All of them.\n\n\"Memories\". These are objects, artwork, books, etc. Anything a person keeps for any reason until they leave the earth. Or your house. A lot of them are only sentimental to the individual and don\u2019t mean much to you. Don\u2019t evaluate this concept yet. Focus, remember your categories. Move along.\n\n\"Paperwork\". This is the serious shit. Your boxes will. WILL. have paperwork that you do not know if you should keep or not. Place every 'document' that is professional correspondence, medical records, housing inspections, homeowners insurance, receipts, etc, into one designated \"Paperwork\" box. Don't stress yourself out wondering what it actually is and if you actually need to keep it just yet. Just determine if it's administrative paperwork or \"paperwork memories\" and sort it first.\n\n\"Paperwork Memories\". This can sometimes be easy to determine, and sometimes it can be difficult. Because in my Gran's final year or so living with us, she clipped everything out of the newspaper from articles on bird care (she has no bird) to saving full page advertisements. There was also a lot... and I mean A LOT of notes that she wrote down from day to day that don't make a lick of sense. A grocery list. The word \"hair\". Someone's phone number. The name \"Nick\". The name \"Lenore\". Notes from my mother who was her primary caretaker. Notes that say \"I'm going to the store. I will be back by 2pm. I love you.\". If in doubt, keep it. And go through it later. But these are still paper memories and go in the \"paper memories\" box. This ALSO INCLUDES stuff that is obviously important and needs to be stored like College Diplomas, yearbook pages, letters from loved ones, cards, etc.\n\n\"I have no idea\". You will come across some shit that's just... weird. Like you really won't have a single idea what to do with it. Make a box for your confusion and come back to it way later.\n\n\u201cTrash\u201d is anything you determine to be trash. If you don't need it, and it doesn't tell a story or represent your mother, let it go. You might not want the scribblings of your parent in their decline of mental capability. You may want to hold onto those pieces a little bit longer. That is absolutely okay.\n\n**Things You Will Need For Sanity**\n\nYou\u2019re almost ready to go through your first container! You will need a couple of things to keep yourself organized.\n\n1. Post-its (Brand name. They stick MUCH better)\n2. A couple of black sharpies. I say a couple because you will misplace it every single fucking time you put it down and you need to be able to pick up another while the first one is probably sitting under a pile of crap.\n3. Buy at least 3 boxes of sandwich baggies (sealable) and 4 boxes of freezer baggies (gallon).\n4. A notebook on a clipboard and a hoard of pens.\n5. Trash bags. Get the good brand.\n6. White Mailing Labels.\n7. File Folders\n8. Scotch tape\n\n**Opening Pandora\u2019s Box**\n\nOnce you have all of your supplies within arm\u2019s or leg\u2019s reach, your organization room is clear, you have one container, and you\u2019ve had your coffee\u2026 Put on a playlist. Pro Tip: Nothing sappy or sad. One sad tune is enough to keep you tunneled on a certain object for way too long and emotionally exhaust you enough to cut your organization day short.\n\nOpen the box. Take a breath.\n\nWhen you come across any of these things, grab a gallon baggie, slap a blank mailing label on it, and grab a sharpie\n\nPhotographs or Polaroids\n\nAdmin Paperwork\n\nPaper Memories\n\nExample: Baggie labeled \u201cTub #1 \u2013 Photographs\u201d or \u201cTub #1 \u2013 Admin Paperwork\u201d\n\n**The Bulky Important Paperwork**\n\nThis is something I learned the hard way. You\u2019re going to come across certain things that take you a couple of minutes to figure out. And they will be bulky, but skirt the line between important admin paperwork and memories.\n\nFor example: I found scatters of 400 pages of my Gran\u2019s book she published in 1998. It took me a good minute to accumulate all of the pages. And they just kept showing up in boxes. For like 3 days, that manuscript was its own category. I threw them all together in the end with the \u201cPaper Memories\u201d category.\n\n**Label. All. Non-Obvious. Items.**\n\nThe term \u201cWhen organizing, you should touch everything only once\u201d, has a more important mental and psychological message, which is \u201cWhen organizing, you should DETERMINE WHAT something is, only once\u201d.\n\nThat folder in Tub #3 that just says \u201cWest Palm Beach\u201d. At first glance, you don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s in that thing. Could be anything, really. So take a look inside. Grab a pen and a notebook on a clipboard. Write down the contents of the folder.\n\nFor Example: On my notebook, the \u201cWest Palm Beach\u201d folder had homeowners insurance, property tax assessments, receipts, email correspondences, inspection reports, final floorplan, and a couple of other things I don\u2019t really remember.\n\nGrab a post-it note, or a piece of paper big enough to tape onto the outside of the folder. Write down, in sharpie, on the note, the contents of what is in that folder.\n\nWhy: When you go through the collection\u2019s stack of paperwork during \u201cRound 2\u201d, you won\u2019t have to spend critical time and energy determining the contents of every folder. When you have big bold labels on stuff, you\u2019re saving your brain from expending energy doing critical thinking later on. You really don\u2019t want to have to pick up the same stack of \u201cWest Palm Beach\u201d 3 times, and every time having to flip through it to figure out the contents. Do the dirty work the first time, and you will save yourself the trouble later.\n\n**Use Those Baggies!**\n\nSo many things can fit into baggies! Notes. Tiny school portraits. Business cards. Newspaper Articles. They can ALL fit into baggies! Label the bag with a the container number they\u2019re in along with the category they belong to, and fill those babies up!\n\nMethod Established. Work Through Your Collection.\n\nGo ahead and sort the rest of the containers into your designated categories.\n\nSort Yourself As You Sort Their Stuff\n\nNever let your piles become super crazy and unorganized. If you have a hoard of labeled baggies just sitting around without being put into their main category, take the time to place them there. It is really easy to let the process take over your entire room/house/life. Don\u2019t let it. Clean as you work.\n\n**Rome Wasn\u2019t Built In A Day**\n\nRemember: Rome wasn't built in a day. It will take days, maybe even a few weeks, to go through every single thing. Especially if you're getting rid of their clothes and food and dishes, furniture, etc as well. You may have put off the boxes and tubs because of the physical and mental and emotional exhaustion it creates. You need to give yourself breaks, remember to drink water, and remember to drop everything and come back to it if it's just getting to be too much for you. You have time. And the process takes time. So take. your. time.\n\nJust as an aside: I really, really want to emphasize a practice of self-care that I had no idea existed until this: Taking your time. It's easy to have a cup of coffee and rush through half a box, but you will be burned out, exhausted, and super irritable every single time. Taking your time will help you be more organized and will let your brain go through the process with ease rather than make it feel like it's some sort of race. You will thank yourself. Remember to eat. Don't become too tunnel visioned. Don't get too caught up in what you find. And do NOT try to create more categories unless you absolutely need to.\n\n**\u201cRound 2\u201d**\n\nYou will end up with containers filled with categories rather than containers filled with \u201cUhhhhh\u201d.\n\nThe photo container will be a whole project within itself. Save that baby for last.\n\nSit down with a category and start figuring out if you need to keep it, keep it and digitize it, shred it, or toss it. The digitization process is also another project within itself. If you determine you need to digitize a document, shove a label on it saying \u201cDIGITIZE\u201d, a label of description of the contents, and then put it in a new \u201cDIGITIZE\u201d category.\n\nI have a method for digitizing and organizing your documents that I will probably write up another time (I\u2019m still doing this and figuring out a solid method. I\u2019m not finished, and I won\u2019t be for a while).\n\nLike with Like\n\nPut things related to each other in their own folder. In \u201cpaper memories\u201d, you will need to determine sub-categories.\n\nExample: \u201cPaper Memories\u201d went from a box of loose papers to \\~7 sub-categories such as \u201cPhyllis\u2019s Education\u201d \u201cLove Letters From Nick\u201d \u201cChildren\u2019s Artwork\u201d \u201cCards\u201d \u201cNotes\u201d and a couple others.\n\nAnother Example: \u201cPaperwork\u201d went from a box of loose papers to a crazy amount of sub-categories including \u201cSale of West Palm Beach House\u201d \u201cMedical Records 2016\u201d \u201cReceipts\u201d \u201cBank Statements\u201d \u201cLawyer\u201d \u201cMiss Kitty\u2019s Vet Records\u201d, etc.\n\n**BONUS ROUND: \u201cPhotos\u201d**\n\nOnce you finish everything but the photographs, you can move to the photos. But you will have trained yourself enough through the first process to know how to sort the photos. And it's basically along the same lines as subcategorizing the other categories. I have about 2000 photos, and I think I have even more at the bottom of another box. So far, I have 34 categories of photos. Everything from \"Roeltgen Family 1996 - 2006 Sonora House, TX\" to \"Cindy's Wedding\" to \"Strange Photo Tour of Cindy's House\" to \"Granny pre-1985\".\n\nI\u2019m still working on photos. It\u2019s a trip. But it is super rewarding.\n\n**All in All\u2026**\n\nYou will become much more comfortable with the entire sorting process the more you go through them. And it will get much, much easier.\n\nI wish you the best of luck. May the organization gods smile upon you. You\u2019re not a robot. You WILL get through this. And I am so, so, so sorry for your loss.", ["One of the things I am grateful to my mom for was that she did this before she got really sick, but knew she had limited time left; to spare me and my sisters from having to do it.

We worked with a company which specializes in such moves. They helped with every stage. Once we were moved, they sold, donated, or trashed everything which was left, and kept 40% of the sales amount.\n\nI am very satisfied with the outcome. I see some apartments where it looks as though people tried to bring everything from their house - ugh, clutter.

I can cohabitate and my parents will just have to deal with that.    On my wedding day it was weird: people kept making remarks like I must be nervous or on edge.  I was: I don't like being at the center of people's attention (that's the bride, but you're a close second as a groom).  But in terms of tying the proverbial knot I was almost casual about it.  Sanguine.  Wasn't even slightly concerned it was the wrong decision.\n\nWhen we got married, we knew it would take work; it's like a structure somewhat separate from both of us that we put in work to maintain over the years.  Because we didn't have to get married, or because we didn't get married because it felt like something we had to do, we seem to have a strange approach to it.\n\nWe're only 16 years in, but it still feels strong.

She could have taken transit, like usual, but she called a taxi and was home in 15 minutes instead of an hour.

I'm now a member of a profession, working 40-70 hours a week (depending on the week), married, have 2 rescue cats and a rescue dog, a decent apartment, and a car. My parents (long divorced) are aging and having some health issues. I had a traumatic, shitty childhood. \n\nAll of this to say that I don't feel like I know how to be a middle-aged adult. My house is constantly a mess. I spend too much time watching television. I just don't know how to age gracefully and would appreciate any advice on managing this transition into a new stage of life. I grew up poor; I'm not poor anymore but have no idea how to manage money. I just feel so confused and baffled all the time, and like I am still living like a 25 year old despite where I'm at in life. It's like I'm stuck and don't know how to move forward.

Not sure what about my post made me come across as male but there you are.", ["I'm a similar age and whilst the specifics of my life are different, what you're saying definitely resonates with me.\n\nUltimately, it's important to differentiate labels from meaning.  Yes, like you I'm middle aged.  I find that fact thoroughly depressing.  I mourn the youth that's far behind me, and I'm scared of getting old.  However, the truth is that nothing special happened on my 40th birthday, or my 42nd for that matter.  I didn't suddenly get a decade older; I got a day older, and a day isn't much at all.  There's no day when you suddenly become middle aged, and no need to suddenly change your wardrobe, personality, or interests.\n\nEntering my 40's was significant for me.  I remember my mother turning 40, because my parents bought a car that day.  My dad died before he turned 50, and obviously I remember that well.  My parents were in their 40's when I left home, rented a flat, and started to be an adult.  It's the decade that I really remember my parents as parents, as opposed to vague memories of early childhood or my new relationship with them once I'd left home.  When I was a kid, my parents always seemed impossibly old - the idea that they had once been children themselves was hard to believe, so to be in your 40's was almost the definition to me of being part of the \"old people\".\n\nI think that's why 40 was so tough for me.  I have kids myself now.  I have a career, a house, a car.  I'm where my parents were when they seemed so old, but this time it seems only yesterday that I was so very young.  Inevitably I look to where my parents are now, and wonder if that will be me just as quickly.\n\nThat's all pretty tough to handle, but the truth is that there is nothing special about the number.  It's a slow process of gradual change, and the fact that I don't feel so different now to when I was 20 reassures me that I'll feel much the same at 60.  I don't really want to be old, but the truth is that there's no thunderclap that changes who you are or who you are supposed to be.  It's just a matter of continuing to enjoy your life as best you can, and trying not to get hung up on a label.", "1. my first reco is to get your finances more organized.  If you don't have any retirement savings, start now.  Go to a reputable investment firm (not a bank) and inquire about getting a financial advisor on board.  Not sure how it works in your country but in Canada, there are many investment brokers/firms that have FAs who manage your portfolio. \n2. start a monthly budget.  Open excel and in one column, add all of your expenses and in another, your income.  Makes it a lot easier to see where money is flowing out of your account and helps to cut costs and save more $.  Google has lots of resources to help with this.\n3. start putting some (liquid) savings away.  Even if it's $100/pay that's better than nothing.  Look around for 3rd party financial institutions that offer better interest than banks' savings account.  In Canada, the large banks are BMO, TD, RBC but we have what I call 3rd party financial institutions that offer a better interest rate for savings -- Tangerine, Saven etc\n4. whenever you get paid, *always pay yourself first*...see #1 and 3.\n5. stop watching so much TV and pick up a book to read instead.

I had a really tiny living space that didn't have enough room for me to put everything away behind tidy doors and cupboards. Decluttering/donating stuff helped a lot, but I was still left with a lot of essential things that didn't have a place. Then I noticed that I was using the same handful of dishes and silverware in my kitchen. My mom was \\*obsessive\\* about putting things away, but I came to realize that that wasn't important to me. Now I have a stylish little countertop dish rack with a repurposed pencil cup for silverware, and I just leave things out and handy, without it looking messy. \n\nSimilarly, a lot of productivity advice tells you it's essential to start your day by making your bed.

I remember there were a number of years that went by and I didn't hear of any deaths, and then suddenly in my 30s I knew a bunch of people who had passed. That represented older family members (grandparents' generation), coworkers or those who had retired (I entered the workforce at 30, so didn't have those connections prior), and I joined my high school reunion committee so suddenly I had notices from our class (300 members) as well as the class above and below our grad year. Those were the hardest to hear as they were very much my age.\n\nI'm in my 50s now, and the numbers have slowed in spite of the year being so crummy. My mother worked as a Hospice nurse and she said 40s are hard on people, and 60s are hard on people, but if you can survive both of those decades you'll probably live a long life.

If you have 20 close family members, 300 Facebook friends, and a graduating class of 500 that means a pool of 820 x .003285 = 2.69 expected dead associates in your 45th year.

As a simple example of the USA trend, when you take out the data from New York and just look at the rest of the USA, daily case numbers are increasing. Bottom line: the only reason the total USA new case numbers look flat right now is because the New York City epidemic was so large and now it is being contained. \n\n...\n\n\n>**We know most people get infected in their own home**. A household member contracts the virus in the community and brings it into the house where sustained contact between household members leads to infection.\n\n>But where are people contracting the infection in the community? I regularly hear people worrying about grocery stores, bike rides, inconsiderate runners who are not wearing masks.... are these places of concern? Well, not really. Let me explain.\n\n \n\n>**In order to get infected you need to get exposed to an infectious dose of the virus;**\n\n\n...\n\n>**A Bathroom:** Bathrooms have a lot of high touch surfaces, door handles, faucets, stall doors. So fomite transfer risk in this environment can be high. We still do not know whether a person releases infectious material in feces or just fragmented virus, but we do know that toilet flushing does aerosolize many droplets. Treat public bathrooms with extra caution (surface and air), until we know more about the risk. \n\n>**A Cough:** A single cough releases about 3,000 droplets and droplets travels at 50 miles per hour. Most droplets are large, and fall quickly (gravity), but many do stay in the air and can travel across a room in a few seconds. \n\n>**A Sneeze:** A single sneeze releases about 30,000 droplets, with droplets traveling at up to 200 miles per hour. Most droplets are small and travel great distances (easily across a room).\n\n\n>If a person is infected, the droplets in a single cough or sneeze may contain as many as 200,000,000 (two hundred million) virus particles which can all be dispersed into the environment around them.\n\n\n>**A breath:** A single breath releases 50 - 5000 droplets. Most of these droplets are low velocity and fall to the ground quickly. There are even fewer droplets released through nose-breathing. Importantly, due to the lack of exhalation force with a breath, viral particles from the lower respiratory areas are not expelled. \n\n...\n\n>**All you have to do is enter that room within a few minutes of the cough/sneeze and take a few breaths and you have potentially received enough virus to establish an infection.**\n\n...\n\n>But with general breathing, 20 copies per minute into the environment, even if every virus ended up in your lungs, you would need 1000 copies divided by 20 copies per minute = **50 minutes.**\n\n>**Speaking** increases the release of respiratory droplets about 10 fold; ~200 copies of virus per minute. Again, assuming every virus is inhaled, it would take ~5 minutes of speaking face-to-face to receive the required dose. \n\n...\n\n>**Anyone you spend greater than 10 minutes with in a face-to-face situation is potentially infected.**\n\n\n...\n\n\n> **We know that at least 44% of all infections--and the majority of community-acquired transmissions--occur from people without any symptoms** (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people). You can be shedding the virus into the environment for up to 5 days before symptoms begin.\n\n\n...\n\n>**the biggest outbreaks are in prisons, religious ceremonies, and workplaces, such as meat packing facilities and call centers. Any environment that is enclosed, with poor air circulation and high density of people, spells trouble.**\n\n\n...\n\n\n>**The main sources for infection are home, workplace, public transport, social gatherings, and restaurants. This accounts for 90% of all transmission events.**\n\n\n...\n\n>Social distancing guidelines don't hold in indoor spaces where you spend a lot of time, as people on the opposite side of the room were infected.  \n\n...\n\n>Social distancing rules are really to protect you with brief exposures or outdoor exposures.\n\n...\n\n>If you are in an open floorplan office, you really need to critically assess the risk (volume, people, and airflow). If you are in a job that requires face-to-face talking or even worse, yelling, you need to assess the risk. \n\n...\n\n>Those infected respiratory droplets land somewhere. Wash your hands often and stop touching your face!\n\n...\n\n>Even if you are gung-ho for reopening  and resuming business as usual, do your part and wear a mask to reduce what you release into the environment.", ["This is why I subscribe to this sub.

Masks are mandated in her state.", "Thanks!", "It's a great article, and she makes many excellent and practical points.   \nBut I'm concerned with an assumption that she makes near the beginning, specific to the necessary infectious dose. (She does offer a disclaimer, stating \u201cthis still needs to be determined experimentally\u201d \u2013 but goes on to use the assumption to illustrate her case.) Specifically, she claims \u201cas few as 1000 SARS-CoV2 viral particles are needed for an infection to take hold.\u201d Yet at least four of her own references contradict this number, suggesting a much lower number of 100. Some quotes I pulled, directly from her references:  \n1. The minimum infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown so far, but researchers suspect it is low.  \n2. Depending on the virus, people need to be exposed to as little as 10 virus particles \u2014 for example, for influenza viruses \u2014 or as many as thousands for other human viruses \u2014 to get infected.  \n3. COVID-19 is very contagious; this may be because few particles are needed for infection (the infectious dose is low), or because infected people release a lot of virus.  \n4. (The most important) We don\u2019t yet know what that \u2018minimum infectious dose\u2019 is for COVID-19, but we might presume it\u2019s around a hundred virus particles.\n\nSo while her own references suggest 100, not 1000, she still uses the larger number for her math. The result is that her examples underestimate the risk by a factor of 10. In one such example she suggests that it would take five minutes of speaking with someone to receive an infectious dose. Based on the reference number, it would take only 30 seconds. She makes many other examples which are similarly flawed.   \nI've written to the author, but she's naturally inundated with emails, so I don't really expect a timely response. I'm wondering if I'm misinterpreting the background, or if she just made a careless mistake. But I see the article being used to justify behavior that may not be advisable if, in fact, her number is incorrect. One such example is claiming that maskless joggers on city sidewalks pose absolutely no threat to pedestrians. Another is encouraging retail employees with underlying health conditions to return to work, since a table will separate the employee from customers asking for assistance. (I'm not saying these are necessarily bad behaviors, just that bad data shouldn't be used to make the decision.)", "\\[Discussion\\]  \nIn Dr. Bromage's example, if someone is infectious, and coughs while in an enclosed room, and emits 200,000,000 virus particles, and someone who is not-infected walks into that cloud of particles wearing an N-95 mask, then they would inhale 10,000,000 particles.\n\nIs that his point?\u00a0 Stay home and don't even get near the possibility of inhaling 1,000 virus particles, because your N-95 mask isn't going to help you at all?\n\nWhat about health care workers who are caring for actively infectious patients?\u00a0 Is he asserting that virtually all of them will get infected, with these calculations?", "Very well written and accurate information.\n\nI've been telling people for months to tune out anything the federal government is saying if they want to stay safe, because actual medical experts are saying basically the opposite of what the feds have been saying.", "Basically, all the precautions and government mandates have done nothing but delay the inevitable, destroy the economy, destroy lives and cause perfectly healthy people to develop health problems because their immune systems have been weakened under quarantine and the added stress.

I've had anxiety for a good 10 years since I was a teenager in school I used to skip classes ect just so I didn't have to deal with the sweaty palms the heart racing and then it progressed worse and worse the more I grew up I started not doing alot of things I originally enjoyed like going out with friends or going to events and eventually when I was invited to events I wouldn't go because of social anxiety so it become a cycle of not going and not going till my Brain come to the term that it will go into fight or flight whenever something like that arises.. I did seek medical advice but I was a idiot and didn't take the medication they give me for it.. really really wish I did as maybe I wouldn't be as bad as I am now.. as now I can have a  anxiety related episode over something as silly as picking my daughter up from school. Which has happened twice in the passed but then other times I can pick her up no problem  I'm on medication now have been for about 2-3 weeks 50mg sertraline and also propanalol noticed my latest anxiety related episode that had me Ill as hell for a good week or so made me super low mood and just would not say depressed. As I still get up do my daily thing get dressed ect I don't feel sad or lonely or that people are sick of me.. as most depressed people feel like.. just more a sense that fuck.. is this for life now.. but ofcourse the anxiety passes and you go back to normal life till the ugly anxiety rears its head again.. most of the time I feel like 99% of my low mood and feeling of depressive state is from the overthinking of anxiety like oh I'm never gonna get better puts me into a depressive state ofcourse. But deep down I know plenty of treatments and help out there for people in my position it's just your brain is so negative sometimes you start believing it.", "I am 34. My anxiety and depression began at 29 and has gradually gotten worse. It sometimes goes away for months and then comes back again\u2026 I\u2019m grateful for these periods of respite because I couldn\u2019t bear it if felt continually anxious or depressed all the time.", "What follows is my experience of being in a similar place to you. \n\nNot at all.  I find that it's getting better.  Since I stopped trying to cling to the world and look for answers out in society, I've noticed things are way better  and way easier to deal with.  I realized that most people out in the world don't have an real foundation in their lives, they have nothing to really base themselves on, and they have to contently readjust their ideas of right and wrong to whatever society says is good and bad this week.  That's a real tough way to live.  \n\nWhen I got so anxious and depressed that I coudln't really bear it anymore, i had a friend invite me to his church - and I haven't looked back sense.  Knowing there are some things in life that are unchanging - that my self-esteen isn't based on what others call me - and knowing that the world might seem utterly insane, but it's that way for a reason, has meant the world to me.  I don't have to worry about what other people call me, because I know what Christ calls me.  I don't have to worry about what the world say is right and wrong, because I know what God says is right and wrong.  \n\nIt's a MASSIVE weight off my shoulders every day of my life man!  It really is living free, knowing that no matter what others call you, you are loved and forgiven.  \n\nI can only tell you that, out in the world, i see so many people like you - angry, anxious, depressed and on the verge of just laying down and letting things overtake you - but I don't know a single member of the family of God who is like that.  Sure, life isn't perfect, and it would be goofy to pretend it is, but knowing where your foundation is makes all the difference.", "Nope, mine is gone cuz I don\u2019t give a fuck anymore. Hahaha", "Wait til you get old and your physical body starts giving out on you. With ailments, pain, and disorders that will not go away until you die.", "It could happen, if you measure the anxiety in terms of the external circumstances you have to deal with.  \n\nBut you\u2019re supposed to be getting better at dealing with it too. That\u2019s part of the tendency for it to go down with age.  \n\nHow do you currently handle the anxiety?", "Absolutely and likely as it should. When I was young I was carefree, now I have obligations, responsibility, bills, options that grow more limited by the day", "Xanex is my friend.", "Try magic mushrooms. It will change your out look on life.", "I'm 13 and I can't take it anymore. I wanna kill myself,but if I do my parents would be miserable and my online friend might kill himself. I'm forced to go to online school witch is mentally challenging and depressing. I can't switch schools since they're a lot of bullying happening over their. I'm stressed out every day and It keeps getting worse and worse. I wanna stop but I can't because parents would yell at me. It feels like time is moving much slower then before. The only break I get is sleeping, but I wouldn't even call that a break since I have to wake up at 7:45 to talk to my suicidal friend on reddit (who is doing much better) and to take care of nana while mom goes to the gym. My aunt moved into my room since we're gonna move to a new house in 2022, so I sleep on the couch. Sometimes I wish I had my own room where if I closed the door mom or aunty would never walk in. Also since we're moving mom packed all her stuff in the living room so it's filled with bins and boxes. I wish I could just grow up already and live a happy life, but that's a long way from now. I hate myself because I've lied to my mom dozens of times about doing my work. I'm a failure and a screw up. Sometimes I think that this is all my fault and that I deserve to be miserable. A year ago I almost commit suicide but didn't. I'm a coward. I told myself things would get better, but it's only gotten worse. I wonder one my dad would think of me? He died when I was seven (Jan 1, 2016)due to cancer. He probably would hate me too. I feel like a slave! Today was especially rough. I almost drowned myself in the bathroom. As the coward I am I couldn't do it. I'm going to bed now to another awful day. I really wanna kill myself. As I was typing nana came back to the living room to eat, again! She does this thing where she sucks her teeth and it's fucking irritating! She's doing it right now! I really really want to kill myself."]], "rbywjs": ["No one prepared you for your best friend's divorce", "I'm 40, so I've seen a few divorces amongst my friends and acquaintances. But my best friend is heading towards divorce. I've known it's been coming. But today she told me her husband is on a waiting list for an apartment nearby, and he's choosing what furniture to take. I broke down in tears. \n\nThis man has been in my life for 21 years. They started dating the same year my husband and I did. They're godparents to one of my children. They're both trying to remain civil and have said that none of us need to choose sides or stop being friends with the other person. I just didn't realize I would be affected this much. I cried for a long time today, and I felt like an ass for not being able to support her right at that moment because I was having my own breakdown about it.", ["You're allowed to feel a loss, too.

Is it the shaking up of stability? Do you see them as different people? Are you afraid you won't see them as often, or their role in your life is changing?", "Two couples who we've been friends with for \\~30 years have divorced recently. I was in both of their weddings. While we have not lived in the same region for many years we considered them close friends and tried to visit in person every few years. In each case we had no idea they were having trouble so were shocked to see them split. It's sad, since there's no clear way to maintain connections with both members of a former couple, especially if/when one or the other finds a new partner. Or if there's any acrimony between them.\n\nIt is a loss. But it's important, I think, for us to remember that when our friends split up they are doing it because they are not happy in their relationship-- it isn't working and ending it is their decision. So we support them, both ideally if it's reasonable to do so. But I've still felt the loss when this happens as well.", "Honestly, be happy for your friend.

I\u2019m sorry for your loss. Your relationship with both will change over time. Sending you a hug.", "[deleted]", "That is so hard. I felt this way about 7 or 8 years ago. We were barely thirty so not as long of a relationship as your friends, but they had been together for years and we were all so close. My husband and I had just moved back to the city they lived and this seemed like this was the life we were living and these were the people we were living it with.    I won\u2019t lie, it changed the dynamic of the whole friend group. Not because people chose sides but because we are so influenced by where we meet up or who plans events and who\u2019s other friends tag along. Things were never the way they \u2018were\u2019 after that.   But we are all still friends. Of course I see her way more often - I like her new partner but we are not close. Him we don\u2019t see as often but that\u2019s because he is more introverted, less likely to make plans. Maybe about once a year there is an event where they are both at. There\u2019s no love lost and it\u2019s almost like a reunion in a way. The relationships are all still there, it\u2019s the dynamic that is different.", "The scary thing about that is \u2014 just to break out the elephant in the room \u2014 you always hear about how it\u2019s contagious amongst close friends.
